    "content": "The bacteria and other microbes in your gut help you digest food and may support immune, heart, and brain health, among other benefits.\nYour body is full of trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi. They are collectively known as the microbiome.\nWhile some bacteria are associated with disease, others are actually extremely important for your immune system, heart, weight and many other aspects of health.\nThis article serves as a guide to the gut microbiome and explains why it\u2019s so important for your health.\nBacteria, viruses, fungi and other microscopic living things are referred to as microorganisms, or microbes, for short.\nTrillions of these microbes exist mainly inside your intestines and on your skin.\nMost of the microbes in your intestines are found in a \u201cpocket\u201d of your large intestine called the cecum, and they are referred to as the gut microbiome.\nAlthough many different types of microbes live inside you, bacteria are the most studied.\nIn fact, there are more bacterial cells in your body than human cells. There are roughly 40 trillion bacterial cells in your body and only 30 trillion human cells. That means you are more bacteria than human (1, 2).\nWhat\u2019s more, there are up to 1,000 species of bacteria in the human gut microbiome, and each of them plays a different role in your body. Most of them are extremely important for your health, while others may cause disease (3).\nAltogether, these microbes may weigh as much as 2\u20135 pounds (1\u20132 kg), which is roughly the weight of your brain. Together, they function as an extra organ in your body and play a huge role in your health.\nThe gut microbiome refers to all of the microbes in your intestines, which act as another organ that\u2019s crucial for your health.\nHumans have evolved to live with microbes for millions of years.\nDuring this time, microbes have learned to play very important roles in the human body. In fact, without the gut microbiome, it would be very difficult to survive.\nThe gut microbiome begins to affect your body the moment you are born.\nYou are first exposed to microbes when you pass through your mother\u2019s birth canal. However, new evidence suggests that babies may come in contact with some microbes while inside the womb (4, 5, 6).\nAs you grow, your gut microbiome begins to diversify, meaning it starts to contain many different types of microbial species. Higher microbiome diversity is considered good for your health (7).\nInterestingly, the food you eat affects the diversity of your gut bacteria.\nAs your microbiome grows, it affects your body in a number of ways, including:\nDigesting breast milk: Some of the bacteria that first begin to grow inside babies\u2019 intestines are called Bifidobacteria. They digest the healthy sugars in breast milk that are important for growth (8, 9, 10).\nDigesting fiber: Certain bacteria digest fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids, which are important for gut health. Fiber may help prevent weight gain, diabetes, heart disease and the risk of cancer (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17).\nHelping control your immune system: The gut microbiome also controls how your immune system works. By communicating with immune cells, the gut microbiome can control how your body responds to infection (18, 19).\nHelping control brain health: New research suggests that the gut microbiome may also affect the central nervous system, which controls brain function (20).\nTherefore, there are a number of different ways in which the gut microbiome can affect key bodily functions and influence your health.\nThe gut microbiome affects the body from birth and throughout life by controlling the digestion of food, immune system, central nervous system and other bodily processes.\nThe Gut Microbiome May Affect Your Weight\nThere are thousands of different types of bacteria in your intestines, most of which benefit your health.\nHowever, having too many unhealthy microbes can lead to disease.\nAn imbalance of healthy and unhealthy microbes is sometimes called gut dysbiosis, and it may contribute to weight gain (21).\nSeveral well-known studies have shown that the gut microbiome differed completely between identical twins, one of whom had obesity and one of whom did not. This demonstrated that differences in the microbiome were not genetic (22, 23).\nInterestingly, in one study, when the microbiome from the twin with obesity was transferred to mice, they gained more weight those that had received the microbiome of the other twin, despite both groups eating the same diet (22).\nThese studies show that microbiome dysbiosis may play a role in weight gain.\nFortunately, probiotics are good for a healthy microbiome and can help with weight loss. Nevertheless, studies suggest that the effects of probiotics on weight loss are probably quite small, with people losing less than 2.2 pounds (1 kg) (24).\nGut dysbiosis may lead to weight gain, but probiotics can potentially restore gut health and help reduce weight.\nThe microbiome can also affect gut health and may play a role in intestinal diseases like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (25, 26, 27).\nThe bloating, cramps and abdominal pain that people with IBS experience may be due to gut dysbiosis. This is because the microbes produce a lot of gas and other chemicals, which contribute to the symptoms of intestinal discomfort (28).\nHowever, certain healthy bacteria in the microbiome can also improve gut health.\nCertain Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which are found in probiotics and yogurt, can help seal gaps between intestinal cells and prevent leaky gut syndrome.\nThese species can also prevent disease-causing bacteria from sticking to the intestinal wall (29, 30).\nIn fact, taking certain probiotics that contain Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli can reduce symptoms of IBS (31).\nA healthy gut microbiome controls gut health by communicating with the intestinal cells, digesting certain foods and preventing disease-causing bacteria from sticking to the intestinal walls.\nThe Gut Microbiome May Benefit Heart Health\nInterestingly, the gut microbiome may even affect heart health (32).\nA recent study in 1,500 people found that the gut microbiome played an important role in promoting \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (33).\nCertain unhealthy species in the gut microbiome may also contribute to heart disease by producing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).\nTMAO is a chemical that contributes to blocked arteries, which may lead to heart attacks or stroke.\nCertain bacteria within the microbiome convert choline and L-carnitine, both of which are nutrients found in red meat and other animal-based food sources, to TMAO, potentially increasing risk factors for heart disease (34, 35, 36).\nHowever, other bacteria within the gut microbiome, particularly Lactobacilli, may help reduce cholesterol when taken as a probiotic (37).\nCertain bacteria within the gut microbiome can produce chemicals that may block arteries and lead to heart disease. However, probiotics may help lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\nIt May Help Control Blood Sugar and Lower the Risk of Diabetes\nThe gut microbiome also may help control blood sugar, which could affect the risk of type 1 and 2 diabetes.\nOne recent study examined 33 infants who had a genetically high risk of developing type 1 diabetes.\nIt found that the diversity of the microbiome dropped suddenly before the onset of type 1 diabetes. It also found that levels of a number of unhealthy bacterial species increased just before the onset of type 1 diabetes (38).\nAnother study found that even when people ate the exact same foods, their blood sugar could vary greatly. This may be due to the types of bacteria in their guts (39).\nThe gut microbiome plays a role in controlling blood sugar and may also affect the onset of type 1 diabetes in children.\nThe gut microbiome may even benefit brain health in a number of ways.\nFirst, certain species of bacteria can help produce chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. For example, serotonin is an antidepressant neurotransmitter that\u2019s mostly made in the gut (40, 41).\nSecond, the gut is physically connected to the brain through millions of nerves.\nTherefore, the gut microbiome may also affect brain health by helping control the messages that are sent to the brain through these nerves (42, 43).\nA number of studies have shown that people with various psychological disorders have different species of bacteria in their guts, compared to healthy people. This suggests that the gut microbiome may affect brain health (44, 45).\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear if this is simply due to different dietary and lifestyle habits.\nA small number of studies have also shown that certain probiotics can improve symptoms of depression and other mental health disorders (46, 47).\nThe gut microbiome may affect brain health by producing brain chemicals and communicating with nerves that connect to the brain.\nHow Can You Improve Your Gut Microbiome?\nThere are many ways to improve your gut microbiome, including:\nEat a diverse range of foods: This can lead to a diverse microbiome, which is an indicator of good gut health. In particular, legumes, beans and fruit contain lots of fiber and can promote the growth of healthy Bifidobacteria (48, 49, 50, 51).\nEat fermented foods: Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kefir all contain healthy bacteria, mainly Lactobacilli, and can reduce the amount of disease-causing species in the gut (52).\nLimit your intake of artificial sweeteners: Some evidence has shown that artificial sweeteners like aspartame increase blood sugar by stimulating the growth of unhealthy bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae in the gut microbiome (53).\nEat prebiotic foods: Prebiotics are a type of fiber that stimulates the growth of healthy bacteria. Prebiotic-rich foods include artichokes, bananas, asparagus, oats and apples (54).\nBreastfeed for at least six months: Breastfeeding is very important for the development of the gut microbiome. Children who are breastfed for at least six months have more beneficial Bifidobacteria than those who are bottle-fed (55).\nEat whole grains: Whole grains contain lots of fiber and beneficial carbs like beta-glucan, which are digested by gut bacteria to benefit weight, cancer risk, diabetes and other disorders (56, 57).\nTry a plant-based diet: Vegetarian diets may help reduce levels of disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli, as well as inflammation and cholesterol (58, 59).\nEat foods rich in polyphenols: Polyphenols are plant compounds found in red wine, green tea, dark chocolate, olive oil and whole grains. They are broken down by the microbiome to stimulate healthy bacterial growth (60, 61).\nTake a probiotic supplement: Probiotics are live bacteria that can help restore the gut to a healthy state after dysbiosis. They do this by \u201creseeding\u201d it with healthy microbes (62).\nTake antibiotics only when necessary: Antibiotics kill many bad and good bacteria in the gut microbiome, possibly contributing to weight gain and antibiotic resistance. Thus, only take antibiotics when medically necessary (63).\nEating a wide variety of high-fiber and fermented foods supports a healthy microbiome. Taking probiotics and limiting antibiotics can also be beneficial.\nYour gut microbiome is made up of trillions of bacteria, fungi and other microbes.\nThe gut microbiome plays a very important role in your health by helping control digestion and benefiting your immune system and many other aspects of health.\nAn imbalance of unhealthy and healthy microbes in the intestines may contribute to weight gain, high blood sugar, high cholesterol and other disorders.\nTo help support the growth of healthy microbes in your gut, eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fermented foods.",

    "title": "What Is Your Gut Microbiome?",
    "content": "Your gut microbiome is a microscopic world within the world of your larger body. The trillions of microorganisms that live there affect each other and their environment in various ways. They also appear to influence many aspects of your overall health, both within your digestive system and outside of it.\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nA biome is a distinct ecosystem characterized by its environment and its inhabitants. Your gut \u2014 inside your intestines \u2014 is in fact a miniature biome, populated by trillions of microscopic organisms. These microorganisms include over a thousand species of bacteria, as well as viruses, fungi and parasites.\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nYour gut microbiome is unique to you. Infants inherit their first gut microbes during vaginal delivery or breastfeeding. Later, your diet and other environmental exposures introduce new microbes to your biome. Some of these exposures can also harm and diminish your gut microbiota.\nWhy is the gut microbiome important?\nMost of the microorganisms in our guts have a symbiotic relationship with us, their hosts. That means we both benefit from the relationship. We provide them with food and shelter, and they provide important services for our bodies. These helpful microbes also help to keep potentially harmful ones in check.\nYou can think of your gut microbiome as a diverse native garden that you rely on for nutritious foods and medicines. When your garden is healthy and thriving, you thrive, too. But if the soil is depleted or polluted, or if pests or weeds are overrunning the helpful plants, it can upset your whole ecosystem.\nWhat does your gut microbiome do?\nYour gut microbiome interacts with many of your body systems and assists with many body functions. It plays such an active role in your body that some healthcare providers have described it as being almost like an organ itself. Some of these interactions we\u2019re still learning about, while others are well known.\nBacteria in your gut help break down certain complex carbohydrates and dietary fibers that you can\u2019t break down on your own. They produce short-chain fatty acids \u2014 an important nutrient \u2014 as byproducts. They also provide the enzymes necessary to synthesize certain vitamins, including B1, B9, B12 and K.\nThese might seem like small nutrients, but micronutrient deficiencies can have a big impact on your health. (See: vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency and vitamin K deficiency.) Short-chain fatty acids, in particular, feed the cells in your gut lining and help to keep your overall gut environment healthy.\nGut bacteria also help to metabolize bile in your intestines. Your liver sends bile to your small intestine to help you digest fats. When that\u2019s done, bacteria and their enzymes help to break it down so that the bile acids can be reabsorbed and recycled by your liver. This is called enterohepatic circulation.\nIf this process stopped working, your body would be unable to recycle bile acids and your liver wouldn\u2019t have enough to produce new bile. Your digestive system wouldn\u2019t get the bile it needs to digest and absorb fats. And leftover cholesterol, one of the components of bile, would build up in your blood.\nBeneficial microbes in your gut help to train your immune system to tell them apart from the unhelpful, pathogenic types. Your gut is your largest immune system organ, containing up to 80% of your body\u2019s immune cells. These cells help to clear out the many pathogens that pass through it every day.\nHelpful gut microbes also compete directly with unhelpful types for real estate and nutrients, preventing them from taking up too much territory. Some of the chronic bacterial infections that can affect your GI tract, including C. difficile and H. pylori, are directly related to having a diminished gut microbiome.\nShort-chain fatty acids, the byproducts of helpful gut bacteria, have important benefits for your immune system. They help maintain your gut barrier, keeping the bacteria and bacterial toxins inside from escaping into your bloodstream. They also have anti-inflammatory properties for your gut.\nInflammation is a function of your immune system, but it can malfunction, becoming hyper-reactive. Chronic inflammation is a feature of autoimmune disease and may have a role in many other diseases, including cancer. Short-chain fatty acids appear to suppress these types of inflammatory reactions.\nGut microbes can affect your nervous system through the gut-brain axis \u2014 the network of nerves, neurons and neurotransmitters that runs through your GI tract. Certain bacteria actually produce or stimulate the production of neurotransmitters (like serotonin) that send chemical signals to your brain.\nBacterial products may also affect your nervous system. Short-chain fatty acids appear to have positive effects, while bacterial toxins might damage nerves. Researchers continue to investigate how your gut microbiome might be involved in various neurological, behavioral, nerve pain and mood disorders.\nGut microbes and their products also interact with endocrine cells in your gut lining. These cells (enteroendocrine cells) make your gut the largest endocrine system organ in your body. They secrete hormones that regulate aspects of your metabolism, including blood sugar, hunger and satiety.\nResearchers continue to explore how your gut microbiome might be involved in metabolic syndrome (obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes) and excess fat storage in your liver. These conditions have some relationship with certain gut microbiota, although exactly what it is isn\u2019t clear yet.\nYour \u201cgut\u201d roughly refers to your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Most people use it to mean your intestines. You have some gut microbiota in your stomach and small intestine, but most of them are in your large intestine (colon). They float around inside or attach to the mucous lining on the inner walls (mucosa).\nThe types of gut bacteria that live in your colon are different from the types that live elsewhere. They\u2019re mostly anaerobic bacteria that require a low-oxygen environment to survive. The higher oxygen, faster movement and strong digestive juices in your upper GI tract prevent them from colonizing there.\nAnaerobic gut bacteria perform important functions within your colon that only they can. They help break down indigestible fibers in your digestive tract and produce essential nutrients that you can\u2019t get otherwise. By the same token, these organisms are only helpful to you within their natural microbiome.\nIf these bacteria stray beyond your colon, they can be harmful. Colon bacteria that manage to creep up and settle in your small intestine can interfere with digestive processes there. Colon bacteria that invade your colon wall, or that escape through a wound in your colon wall, can cause an infection in your body.\nHealthcare providers use the term \u201cdysbiosis\u201d to refer to an unbalanced or unhealthy gut microbiome.\nA loss or deficit of beneficial bacteria.\nOvergrowth of potentially pathogenic (bad) bacteria.\nLoss of overall bacterial diversity.\nDysbiosis may start with one of these three factors, but the others tend to soon follow. A loss of beneficial bacteria leaves your gut vulnerable to more disease-causing or invasive types. These types can overrun the other microorganisms living there, diminishing the overall diversity in your microbiome.\nWhat environmental factors affect your gut microbiome?\nJust like a garden, your gut microbiome is affected by the nutrients and pollutants, pests and weeds it\u2019s exposed to. The diversity of plants and their different seasons or life cycles also affect it. In your gut, this means your diet, chemical exposures, disease-causing organisms and bowel movement regularity.\nThe variety of microorganisms in your gut microbiome requires a variety of plant fibers to thrive. Different organisms prefer different whole foods. In turn, they produce short-chain fatty acids and other byproducts that nourish your gut and lower the pH inside, which favors the more beneficial microbes.\nOn the other hand, a diet high in sugar and saturated fats tends to favor the less helpful types of microorganisms. Processed foods not only lack fiber and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) but also tend to come with many additives and preservatives, which can be harmful to your microbiome.\nChemicals that may poison your microbiome include environmental toxins like alcohol, tobacco smoke and pollutants. Additionally, pesticides like antibiotics can wipe out the good bacteria along with the bad. Other medications, like acid blockers, can affect your microbiome by changing the pH inside.\nYour gut microbiome can usually recover from temporary chemical exposure, like a brief prescription for a medication you need to get well. But chronic exposure can affect its composition. If you take certain medications or use substances like alcohol frequently, it may prevent certain microbes from thriving.\nIn a healthy gut microbiome, different types of microorganisms support each other. Consider how different plants in a garden cross-pollinate or nourish the soil for each other. For example, some types feed other types by breaking down compounds, or their byproducts change the acidity of the \u201csoil.\u201d\nOn the other hand, a microbiome that doesn\u2019t support a healthy variety of microorganisms is more vulnerable to being overrun by the invasive types. Without healthy competition, these \u201cweeds\u201d and \u201cpests\u201d take over the habitat and deplete the resources that the other types need to survive.\nYour motility is the regular movement of your bowels. This is how your \u201ccrop\u201d of microorganisms turns over. After traveling through your colon, where they help break down undigested compounds into nutrients you can absorb, many come out with your poop. How long this takes affects your microbiome.\nThe movement of food and waste through your GI tract helps to distribute different microbes into different places along the way. If it\u2019s too fast, they don\u2019t have time to settle or to do their jobs before clearing out. But if it\u2019s too slow, they can overeat and overgrow, spreading beyond their territory.\nWhat health conditions and disorders relate to my gut microbiome?\nConditions directly related to gut dysbiosis include:\nInfections. Invasive pathogens (disease-causing organisms) can cause temporary or chronic infections in your gut. They can cause diarrhea, inflammation (colitis) and toxic damage to your gut lining. Some types even directly invade your gut barrier, threatening to escape into your bloodstream and go systemic. Dysbiosis weakens your gut\u2019s defenses against these pathogens.\nSIBO. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is dysbiosis in your small intestine. It means certain types of bacteria there are overgrown, using too many resources and producing too many byproducts. In some cases, bacteria from your large intestine have migrated and settled in your small intestine, where they don\u2019t really belong. This can be a result of slow gut motility.\nInflammatory bowel disease. IBD is a collection of autoimmune conditions in your gut that includes ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Gut dysbiosis is one of the criteria for diagnosing IBD. Researchers still aren\u2019t sure which comes first, but they know the two conditions are related and that each contributes to the other, making it worse.\nAtherosclerosis. Certain less-desirable gut bacteria contribute to your cardiovascular risk by producing a byproduct called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). This byproduct builds up in your arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis (hardening of your arteries). It\u2019s one of the substances that cardiac blood tests check for when determining your risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).\nOther conditions that may be indirectly related to gut dysbiosis include:\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nWhat are common signs or symptoms of a problem with my gut microbiome?\nTypical symptoms of gut dysbiosis include:\nCan I take a test to check the health of my gut microbiome?\nMany commercial labs offer gut microbiome testing kits to consumers. You can send a poop sample to a lab, and they\u2019ll send you back a report telling you a little bit about the composition of your gut microbiome. Clinical healthcare providers generally don\u2019t use or recommend these tests, though.\nThe reason is that we still don\u2019t know enough about the different types of gut microbiota or how they affect our health to make a report like this useful. There\u2019s a lot of exciting research in progress, but it has some ways to go before a gut microbiome test can give you practical, personalized healthcare advice.\nHow do healthcare providers test for gut dysbiosis?\nHealthcare providers don\u2019t check for dysbiosis, per se, but they can check for specific conditions, like infections and bacterial overgrowth. They may use blood tests, stool tests or breath tests. A breath test can measure different gases in your breath that are the byproducts of certain bacteria in your gut.\nHow do healthcare providers treat gut microbiome conditions?\nSome medical treatments for your gut microbiome include:\nElimination diet. An elimination diet is a short-term diet designed to isolate the foods causing your gastrointestinal symptoms. These are often foods that your gut microbes like to eat. When too many microbes are eating too many of these foods, they produce too many byproducts, causing intestinal gas, diarrhea and other symptoms. Starving them is one way to reduce them.\nAntibiotics. If you have an infection or overgrowth of a certain gut bacteria, the standard treatment is a course of antibiotics. When that\u2019s done, a healthy gut microbiome can recover. But some people\u2019s guts will need a little help recovering. Healthcare providers might suggest following with supplements like prebiotics and probiotics to help restore your microbiome.\nFecal transplant. One treatment for restoring a severely diminished gut microbiome is fecal transplantation, which means transferring a sampling of gut microbiota from a healthy gut to a diseased one. So far, it\u2019s only been approved to treat recurrent C. diff infections that are resistant to antibiotics. But researchers are looking into it as a treatment for other conditions.\nWhat can I do to take care of my gut microbiome?\nA healthy diet and lifestyle encourages a healthy gut microbiome. For example:\nImprove your gut health naturally with a diverse and plant-rich diet. Aim for a variety of whole foods like whole grains, vegetables and fruits. These offer plenty of dietary fiber for your gut microbes as well as micronutrients for you. These foods also reduce inflammation in your gut, which affects the environment inside. Processed and convenience foods do the opposite.\nTry probiotics and prebiotics. You can get probiotics and prebiotics in supplement form, or from foods. Probiotics are helpful microbes that you can ingest, through supplements or fermented foods, that\u2019ll take up residence in your colon. Your healthcare provider can help you pick the best probiotic for you. Prebiotics are the dietary fibers that feed your helpful gut bacteria.\nUse antibiotics with care. There are times when you need to take antibiotics, but other times when you really don\u2019t. Overuse of antibiotics in the general population leads to antibiotic resistance. In the individual, it can kill your good bacteria along with the bad. Sometimes this disrupts the balance in your gut microbiome, leading the wrong kind to come back stronger.\nThe gut microbiome is a hot topic these days in medical and wellness communities, and it\u2019s easy to see why. These critters seem to have so many tentacles in so many different body systems that it\u2019s possible to imagine they might hold the key to understanding and treating a wide range of intractable diseases.\nAs research continues, healthcare providers are both optimistic and cautious. The more we learn, the more we realize how much there still is to learn. But what we\u2019re learning also goes backward to confirm some of our oldest wellness principles. In particular: a healthy, whole foods diet is key to a healthy gut.\nCleveland Clinic\u2019s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

    "content": "What You Should Know About Your Gut Health\nA healthy gut benefits your entire digestive system \u2014 and more\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the phrase, \u201cYou are what you eat.\u201d And guess what? The old adage is pretty accurate when you consider that your gut health has a far-reaching impact on your overall physical health, immunity, risk for chronic conditions, mental health and more.\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nBut how are those connections made between your gut and the rest of your body, and what does gut health actually mean? Let\u2019s plunge right in.\nYour gastrointestinal (GI) tract (also known as your digestive tract) is the largest part of your digestive system. Composed of a series of connected hollow organs that run from your mouth to your anus (think of it like a long tube), it includes your esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. When you eat food or drink liquid, your body breaks those items down into nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, etc.) as they travel through your digestive tract.\nThose nutrients are then used to fuel your body\u2019s various biological cycles and processes. You have to consume nutrients in order to stay alive. And when those nutrients are broken down, the microorganisms living inside of your small and large intestines go to work to put those nutrients to use. So, your gut health refers to the health of your entire digestive system and the health of the microorganisms living in your digestive tract.\nNeed more info? Here\u2019s a roundup of stories to get you started:\nAccording to digestive disease researcher and registered dietitian\u00a0Gail Cresci, PhD, RD, and registered dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick, RD, there are more than 100 trillion microbes inside of your body, with many of them living inside of your small and large intestines. This area, known as your gut microbiome, plays a role in your body\u2019s ability to digest food, metabolize nutrients and reduce inflammation.\nThis story from gastroenterologist Bret Lashner, MD, sums up nine weird facts you may not have known about your gut, like how your stomach acid is strong enough to burn your skin and how you have detergents in your intestines. Who would\u2019ve guessed?\nBalance is key \u2014 especially when it comes to making sure you have enough good bacteria to counteract the bad bacteria in your gut. Probiotics are just that: They\u2019re beneficial microbes that support the number of good bacteria you have so they can get the job done. You\u2019ll find probiotics in foods and supplements, but you\u2019ll also find specific probiotics that can help with specific conditions. Dr. Cresci explains how to choose the right probiotics for you.\nPrebiotics are a whole other thing. If you think about probiotics as farm animals that produce a variety of products that work for you, then prebiotics are the foods and nutrients that keep your farm animals (in this case, good bacteria) healthy and strong. This primer on prebiotics breaks this explanation down further with the help of Dr. Cresci.\nStill confused about the difference between probiotics and prebiotics? Here\u2019s a comparison of both from Dr. Cresci, and why they matter in different ways.\nFermented foods like kombucha, pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi and even yogurt can help strengthen your gut microbiome. Dr. Cresci gives us five ways fermented foods help keep your gut in check.\nYou can experience a build-up of gas as a byproduct of your gut microbiota breaking down all the nutrients you\u2019ve consumed. This is why you may want to tread softly into probiotic and fiber territory, or you\u2019ll end up feeling bloated and gassy. Luckily, Beth Czerwony, RD, has this list of foods that help soften your bloat.\nWe can\u2019t stress this enough: The more stressed you are, the higher your chances of causing harm to your immune system and overall physical and mental health. Plus, your gut microbiome is responsible for 70% to 80% of your immune system. Registered dietitian nutritionist Courtney Barth, RDN, explains how eating these foods helps reduce inflammation and cortisol levels in your body, which all have a hand in stress, so your immune system can be maintained.\nIt\u2019s important to keep things moving, especially when your food has a long way to go before it gets fully processed. But if you\u2019re constipated, you could experience a backup that results in cramps or intense stomach pain. These home remedies from gastroenterologist\u00a0Samita Garg, MD, can help with constipation by keeping your gut happy and making sure you stay regular.\nThe function of your gut is vast, so of course, when something goes wrong, it can be hard to tell exactly what\u2019s causing problems. If you\u2019re having issues with your digestive system or experiencing any pain, you should see a healthcare provider for testing and treatment that\u2019s specific to your case \u2014 but this story on digestion troubles from gastroenterologist\u00a0Brian Baggott, MD, can help you parse out some details on exactly what might be causing you some discomfort.\nUnderstanding just how your gut microbiome works \u2014 and what helps it work better \u2014 can be incredibly overwhelming at first. But these small steps to improving your digestive tract from gastroenterologist\u00a0Christine Lee, MD, can go a long way as you make an invested effort to have healthier eating habits.\nLearn more about our editorial process.\nYour gut never really stops working \u2014 and that\u2019s not even the most incredible thing about it\nNo, it doesn\u2019t stay in your stomach for seven years\nAn expert explains a complicated relationship\nMedications, inactivity, poor diet may all play a role in your stomach trouble\nNausea, fullness, heartburn and unexplained weight loss may signal that something is going on with your GI system\nChoose foods that are low in fiber and easy to chew and swallow\nIf you\u2019re feeling short of breath, sleep can be tough \u2014 propping yourself up or sleeping on your side may help\nIf you fear the unknown or find yourself needing reassurance often, you may identify with this attachment style\nIf you\u2019re looking to boost your gut health, it\u2019s better to get fiber from whole foods",

    "content": "How To Improve Your Gut Health Naturally\nEating a diet heavy on plant-based food can keep your digestive system in top form\nIf you\u2019ve got a bad feeling in your belly, it\u2019s best to pay attention. What\u2019s happening in your digestive tract can set the tone for your whole day. (Remember the last time you battled diarrhea? Yeah \u2026 that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.)\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nKeeping your gut healthy and happy often comes down to what\u2019s put in it. Diet and nutrition can make a BIG difference when it comes to managing gastrointestinal issues that make you feel like crud.\nThe good news? It\u2019s pretty simple to find food that allows your gut to flourish while taking care of business downstairs, says gastroenterologist Christine Lee, MD.\nSo, let\u2019s set a grocery store shopping list set to boost your gut health.\n\u201cYou are what you eat.\u201d That old saying dates back to 1825 \u2014 and it\u2019s as true today as when French bon vivant Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin penned the axiom in his renowned foodie book The Physiology of Taste.\nTwo centuries of research have only reinforced the concept, says Dr. Lee. A healthy diet helps build a healthy gut, which is key for maintaining a strong immune system, boosting mental health and just feeling hunky-dory.\nEating the right foods fortifies your gut\u2019s complex microbiome and the trillions of microbes \u2014 including \u201cgood\u201d bacteria \u00ad\u2014 that call it home. It\u2019s essential for your health to maintain a good balance of gut bacteria.\n\u201cWhat you eat affects your gut health and overall health,\u201d reiterates Dr. Lee. \u201cIf you put substandard food in, that balance is disrupted and your body will not treat you well.\u201d\nSo, what happens when your gut gets off kilter? Symptoms of poor gut health include:\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to stay attuned to these symptoms, particularly when they seem to closely follow meals,\u201d notes Dr. Lee. \u201cThese are all indicators that you might want to look at dietary changes to help your gut.\u201d\nWhen it comes to selecting the right food to help your gut stay in tip-top shape, you\u2019ve got a lot of options. In fact, it\u2019s better for your system to eat a wide array of healthy foods, says Dr. Lee.\nDietary diversity leads to a healthier microbiome with more species of \u201cgood\u201d bacteria. That broader population of microbes puts your gut in a better position to handle anything that comes along.\n\u201cYou want to have a wide variety in your diet,\u201d she says. \u201cTry to mix it up.\u201d\nJust make sure these foods are in (or out of) the mix.\nPlant foods are packed with soluble and insoluble fiber, which aid digestion and keep your gut\u2019s plumbing flowing. (Regularly emptying out your bowels is something that makes your body happy, states Dr. Lee.)\nAim for five to seven servings of fruit and vegetables per day. Be adventurous and get creative in the process, too.\n\u201cGet lots of different colors on your plate \u2014 greens, reds, oranges, yellows,\u201d recommends Dr. Lee. \u201cA rainbow sort of diet will provide a wide variety of vitamins and nutrients your body needs.\u201d\nFresh produce is best, but canned and frozen fruit and veggies can offer extra convenience. (Try to avoid canned produce with added sodium or that\u2019s swimming in sugar-sweetened syrup. Watch for extra sugar in frozen options, too.)\nAnother way to stay \u201cregular\u201d with your bathroom routine is to eat food made with fiber-rich whole grains. The list in this category reads like a morning crop report in farm country, with grains such as:\nWhole grains that are unprocessed retain more natural goodness compared to milled or refined grains that have nutritious layers stripped off.\nWhen shopping for whole grain items such as bread or cereal, make sure that the words \u201cwhole grains\u201d appear among the first ingredients listed. Try to choose items with at least 3 grams of dietary fiber per serving for the best benefit.\n(Learn more about how much fiber you need daily from a registered dietitian.)\nThere\u2019s something special in fermented foods \u2026 and it\u2019s alive. (Don\u2019t be spooked by that creepy fact. It\u2019s actually a good thing.)\nMany fermented foods include live microorganisms that can be beneficial to your gastrointestinal health, says Dr. Lee. These foods bring more good bacteria to the party in your gut\u2019s microbiome.\nFermented foods are a type of probiotic. Examples of fermented food include:\nKefir (a yogurt-like beverage).\nAs we mentioned the probiotics, it\u2019s only fair to mention prebiotics. Prebiotics work in tandem with probiotics to keep your gut and its microbiome operating at peak efficiency, explains Dr. Lee.\nIn the simplest of explanations, prebiotics act as a food source to support the good bacteria in your gut while probiotics add to the population of good bacteria. (Learn more about probiotics and prebiotics and their unique relationship in this explainer from a registered dietitian.)\nExamples of prebiotics include garlic, onions, artichokes, bananas, apples and whole oats.\nThe food on this list won\u2019t surprise you. Odds are you\u2019ve felt a little belly pain after overdoing it on one or more of the items. That\u2019s a sign. \u201cYour body has a way of sending a message,\u201d says Dr. Lee.\nFoods to limit or avoid include:\nSalty, high-sodium items. Eating foods high in sodium content \u2014 chips, lunch meat and many prepared foods, for instance \u00ad\u2014 can slow digestion and lead to bloating, says Dr. Lee. (Get tips for reducing your sodium and salt intake.)\nProcessed foods. Preservatives added to processed foods really make things difficult for your digestive system. \u201cIt slows down motility and lets bad bacteria build-up,\u201d she says.\nFried food. Cooking food in oils laden with saturated fats just doesn\u2019t lead to a finished product that sits well in your belly, which can lead to indigestion, gas and diarrhea.\nArtificial sweeteners. Let\u2019s just say that any food items that are considered \u201cartificial\u201d will probably be more difficult for your body to process. (Add it to the list of health concerns with these low-calorie sugar imitators.)\nRed meat. Your gut\u2019s response (and struggles) with red meat has been associated with increasing your risk of heart disease. Try to limit portions of red meat to no more than 3 ounces twice a week.\nIn general, a diet with a heavy emphasis on plant-based foods will help your gut stay healthy and happy. And if you\u2019re going to eat food on the \u201cavoid-it\u201d list \u2014 and let\u2019s be honest, we all will \u2014 do so in moderation.\n\u201cIn general, though, simple foods are the best for our bodies,\u201d says Dr. Lee. \u201cYour gut will let you know that, too.\u201d\nLearn more about our editorial process.\nYou don\u2019t need a strenuous or expensive fitness routine to keep your digestive tract in shape\nGut health is an important element of your overall physical and mental health\nYou can reduce how much added sugar you consume by tracking what you eat, reading labels and limiting portions of the sweet stuff\nIt depends on factors like your age, activity level and if you want to maintain, lose or gain weight\nAn obsession with eating \u2018clean\u2019 or \u2018healthy\u2019 can be both physically and emotionally damaging\nNausea, fullness, heartburn and unexplained weight loss may signal that something is going on with your GI system\nIt\u2019s hard to beat the benefits of oats, but be cautious of sugared-up instant oatmeal options\nChoose foods that are low in fiber and easy to chew and swallow\nIf you\u2019re feeling short of breath, sleep can be tough \u2014 propping yourself up or sleeping on your side may help\nIf you fear the unknown or find yourself needing reassurance often, you may identify with this attachment style\nIf you\u2019re looking to boost your gut health, it\u2019s better to get fiber from whole foods",

    "content": "Jump to: What is the microbiome? How microbiota benefit the body The role of probiotics Can diet affect one\u2019s microbiota? Future areas of research\nPicture a bustling city on a weekday morning, the sidewalks flooded with people rushing to get to work or to appointments. Now imagine this at a microscopic level and you have an idea of what the microbiome looks like inside our bodies, consisting of trillions of microorganisms (also called microbiota or microbes) of thousands of different species. [1] These include not only bacteria but fungi, parasites, and viruses. In a healthy person, these \u201cbugs\u201d coexist peacefully, with the largest numbers found in the small and large intestines but also throughout the body. The microbiome is even labeled a supporting organ because it plays so many key roles in promoting the smooth daily operations of the human body.\nEach person has an entirely unique network of microbiota that is originally determined by one\u2019s DNA. A person is first exposed to microorganisms as an infant, during delivery in the birth canal and through the mother\u2019s breast milk. [1] Exactly which microorganisms the infant is exposed to depends solely on the species found in the mother. Later on, environmental exposures and diet can change one\u2019s microbiome to be either beneficial to health or place one at greater risk for disease.\nThe microbiome consists of microbes that are both helpful and potentially harmful. Most are symbiotic (where both the human body and microbiota benefit) and some, in smaller numbers, are pathogenic (promoting disease). In a healthy body, pathogenic and symbiotic microbiota coexist without problems. But if there is a disturbance in that balance\u2014brought on by infectious illnesses, certain diets, or the prolonged use of antibiotics or other bacteria-destroying medications\u2014dysbiosis occurs, stopping these normal interactions. As a result, the body may become more susceptible to disease.\nHow Microbiota Benefit the Body\nMicrobiota stimulate the immune system, break down potentially toxic food compounds, and synthesize certain vitamins and amino acids, [2] including the B vitamins and vitamin K. For example, the key enzymes needed to form vitamin B12 are only found in bacteria, not in plants and animals. [3]\nSugars like table sugar and lactose (milk sugar) are quickly absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine, but more complex carbohydrates like starches and fibers are not as easily digested and may travel lower to the large intestine. There, the microbiota help to break down these compounds with their digestive enzymes. The fermentation of indigestible fibers causes the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that can be used by the body as a nutrient source but also play an important role in muscle function and possibly the prevention of chronic diseases, including certain cancers and bowel disorders. Clinical studies have shown that SCFA may be useful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. [2]\nThe microbiota of a healthy person will also provide protection from pathogenic organisms that enter the body such as through drinking or eating contaminated water or food.\nLarge families of bacteria found in the human gut include Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, and Firmicutes. [4] In the colon, a low oxygen environment, you will find the anaerobic bacteria Peptostreptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium. [4] These microbes are believed to prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria by competing for nutrients and attachment sites to the mucus membranes of the gut, a major site of immune activity and production of antimicrobial proteins. [5,6]\nCan Diet Affect One\u2019s Microbiota?\nIn addition to family genes, environment, and medication use, diet plays a large role in determining what kinds of microbiota live in the colon. [2] All of these factors create a unique microbiome from person to person. A high-fiber diet in particular affects the type and amount of microbiota in the intestines. Dietary fiber can only be broken down and fermented by enzymes from microbiota living in the colon. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are released as a result of fermentation. This lowers the pH of the colon, which in turn determines the type of microbiota present that would survive in this acidic environment. The lower pH limits the growth of some harmful bacteria like Clostridium difficile. Growing research on SCFA explores their wide-ranging effects on health, including stimulating immune cell activity and maintaining normal blood levels of glucose and cholesterol.\nFoods that support increased levels of SCFA are indigestible carbohydrates and fibers such as inulin, resistant starches, gums, pectins, and fructooligosaccharides. These fibers are sometimes called prebiotics because they feed our beneficial microbiota. Although there are supplements containing prebiotic fibers, there are many healthful foods naturally containing prebiotics. The highest amounts are found in raw versions of the following: garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens, bananas, and seaweed. In general, fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains like wheat, oats, and barley are all good sources of prebiotic fibers.\nBe aware that a high intake of prebiotic foods, especially if introduced suddenly, can increase gas production (flatulence) and bloating. Individuals with gastrointestinal sensitivities such as irritable bowel syndrome should introduce these foods in small amounts to first assess tolerance. With continued use, tolerance may improve with fewer side effects.\nIf one does not have food sensitivities, it is important to gradually implement a high-fiber diet because a low-fiber diet may not only reduce the amount of beneficial microbiota, but increase the growth of pathogenic bacteria that thrive in a lower acidic environment.\nProbiotic foods may contain beneficial live microbiota that may further alter one\u2019s microbiome. These include fermented foods like kefir, yogurt with live active cultures, pickled vegetables, tempeh, kombucha tea, kimchi, miso, and sauerkraut. Note that not all fermented foods contain live microorganisms, especially if they have been heated or pasteurized after fermentation that destroys the bacteria (e.g., sourdough bread, heat-treated fermented vegetables).\nExploring probiotics and gut health\nProbiotics\u2014whether from food or supplements\u2014are a hot topic of consumer interest. However, would a relatively healthy person benefit from supplementation of probiotics, or is a fiber-rich diet sufficient for cultivating a robust gut microbiome? Learn more about probiotics, and review available research on supplements and health.\nThe microbiome is a living dynamic environment where the relative abundance of species may fluctuate daily, weekly, and monthly depending on diet, medication, exercise, and a host of other environmental exposures. However, scientists are still in the early stages of understanding the microbiome\u2019s broad role in health and the extent of problems that can occur from an interruption in the normal interactions between the microbiome and its host.

    "content": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that affects the stomach and intestines, also called the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include cramping, belly pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea or constipation, or both. IBS is an ongoing condition that needs long-term management.\nOnly a small number of people with IBS have severe symptoms. Some people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress. More-severe symptoms can be treated with medicine and counseling.\nIBS doesn't cause changes in bowel tissue or increase risk of colorectal cancer.\nA Book: Mayo Clinic on Digestive Health\nNutritional Supplements at Mayo Clinic Store\nSymptoms of IBS vary but are usually present for a long time. The most common include:\nBelly pain, cramping or bloating that is related to passing stool.\nChanges in appearance of stool.\nChanges in how often you are passing stool.\nOther symptoms that are often related include sensation of incomplete evacuation and increased gas or mucus in the stool.\nVideo: How irritable bowel syndrome affects you\nIBS is a functional disorder. Even though the digestive tract looks normal, it doesn't function as it should. Muscles in the intestines move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that moves the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscles in the intestines spasm. That means the contractions are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasms are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS results from oversensitive nerve endings in the digestive tract. Small bubbles of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating.\nSee a healthcare professional if you have a persistent change in bowel habits or other symptoms of IBS. They may mean a more serious condition, such as colon cancer. More-serious symptoms include:\nPain that isn't relieved by passing gas or stool.\nIrritable bowel syndrome care at Mayo Clinic\nNarrow stools: Should I be concerned?\nThere is a problem with\n information submitted for this request.

Factors that appear to play a role include:\nMuscle contractions in the intestine. The walls of the intestines are lined with layers of muscle that contract as they move food through the digestive tract. Contractions that are stronger and last longer than usual can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea. Weak contractions can slow food passage and lead to hard, dry stools.\nNervous system. Issues with the nerves in the digestive system may cause discomfort when the belly area, called the abdomen, stretches from gas or stool. Poorly coordinated signals between the brain and the intestines can cause the body to overreact to changes that typically occur in the digestive process. This can result in pain, diarrhea or constipation.\nSevere infection. IBS can develop after a severe bout of diarrhea caused by bacteria or a virus. This is called gastroenteritis. IBS also might be associated with a surplus of bacteria in the intestines, known as bacterial overgrowth.\nEarly-life stress. People exposed to stressful events, especially in childhood, tend to have more symptoms of IBS.\nChanges in gut microbes. Examples include changes in bacteria, fungi and viruses, which typically live in the intestines and play a key role in health. Research indicates that the microbes in people with IBS might differ from those in people who don't have IBS.\nSymptoms of IBS can be triggered by:\nFood. The role of food allergy or intolerance in IBS isn't fully understood. A true food allergy rarely causes IBS. But many people have worse IBS symptoms when they eat or drink certain foods or beverages. These include wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, milk and carbonated drinks.\nStress. Most people with IBS experience worse or more-frequent symptoms during periods of increased stress. But while stress may make symptoms worse, it doesn't cause them.\nIrritable bowel syndrome care at Mayo Clinic\nHow irritable bowel syndrome affects you\nMany people have occasional symptoms of IBS. But you're more likely to have the syndrome if you:\nAre young. IBS occurs more often in people under age 50.\nAre female. In the United States, IBS is more common among women. Estrogen therapy before or after menopause also is a risk factor for IBS.\nHave a family history of IBS. Genes may play a role, as may shared factors in a family's environment or a combination of genes and environment.\nHave anxiety, depression or other mental health issues. A history of sexual, physical or emotional abuse also might be a risk factor.\nLong-lasting constipation or diarrhea can cause hemorrhoids.\nIn addition, IBS is associated with:\nPoor quality of life. Many people with moderate to severe IBS report poor quality of life. Research indicates that people with IBS miss three times as many days from work as do those without bowel symptoms.\nMood disorders. Experiencing the symptoms of IBS can lead to depression or anxiety. Depression and anxiety also can make IBS worse.\nIrritable bowel syndrome care at Mayo Clinic\nHadjivasilis A, et al.

    "content": "Symptoms & Causes of Gas in the Digestive Tract\nWhen should I talk with a doctor about my gas symptoms?\nWhat health conditions can cause problems with gas symptoms?\nGas symptoms vary from person to person. Common symptoms of gas in the digestive tract\u00a0include belching, bloating\u00a0and distention, and passing gas. Having some gas symptoms is normal, especially during or after meals.\nGas symptoms may be a problem if they occur often, bother you, or affect your daily activities.\nBelching, or burping, is a release of gas from your stomach\u00a0through your mouth. People typically belch up to 30 times a day.3\nSome people may feel they belch more often than normal. In some cases, people belch a lot because they swallow too much air and release the air before it enters the stomach.\nBloating is a feeling of fullness or swelling in your abdomen, or belly. If your abdomen becomes larger than usual, doctors call this distention. Only about half of people with bloating also have distention.4,5 Some people may also feel abdominal discomfort or pain when they have bloating or distention.\nStudies suggest that people pass gas through the anus\u00a0an average of 8 to 14 times a day.6 However, some people may pass gas more often. Experts consider passing gas up to 25 times a day to be normal.6,7\nExcess gas in the digestive tract that leads to passing gas is called flatulence. The gas that passes is called flatus. People who have problems with flatulence may feel they pass too much gas or that the flatus has an unpleasant odor. The odor may be due to sulfur in the flatus.\nWhen should I talk with a doctor about my gas symptoms?\nYou should talk with your doctor if\nyou have other symptoms\u2014such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or weight loss\u2014along with gas symptoms\nGas normally enters your digestive tract when you swallow air and when bacteria\u00a0in your large intestine\u00a0break down undigested carbohydrates. You may have more gas symptoms if you swallow more air or consume more of certain foods and drinks.\nEveryone swallows a small amount of air when eating and drinking. Swallowed air that doesn\u2019t leave your stomach when you belch may move into your intestines and pass through your anus.\nSwallowing more air may lead to more gas and gas symptoms. You swallow more air when you\ndrink carbonated, or fizzy, drinks\nBacteria in your large intestine\nYour large intestine contains a large number of bacteria and some fungi\u00a0and viruses\u00a0that make up the gut microbiome\u2014the microbes in your digestive tract\u00a0that help with digestion. Bacteria in the large intestine help break down carbohydrates and create gas in the process.\nCertain foods and drinks\u00a0contain types of carbohydrates\u2014sugars, starches, and fiber\u2014that your stomach and small intestine\u00a0don\u2019t fully digest. Undigested carbohydrates will pass to your large intestine, where bacteria break them down and create gas. You may have more gas symptoms if you consume more carbohydrates that your stomach and small intestine don\u2019t fully digest.\nWhat health conditions can cause problems with gas symptoms?\nSome health conditions can cause you to have more gas than usual or have more gas symptoms.\nIBS and other functional GI disorders\nFunctional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal bloating and distention, functional constipation, and functional dyspepsia\u00a0may cause problems with gas symptoms.\nFunctional GI disorders are related to problems with how your brain and your gut work together. These problems can cause you to feel more bloating or abdominal pain or can affect how gas moves through your intestines.\nProblems digesting carbohydrates\nPeople who have problems digesting certain carbohydrates may experience digestive symptoms\u2014such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea\u2014after they consume certain foods or drinks. Problems digesting carbohydrates include\nlactose intolerance, in which people have digestive symptoms after consuming foods or drinks that contain lactose\ndietary fructose intolerance, in which people have digestive symptoms after consuming foods or drinks that contain fructose\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in your small intestine. These bacteria can produce extra gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is most often a complication of other health conditions.\nOther digestive diseases and conditions\nA number of other digestive diseases and conditions may lead to more gas or gas symptoms, including\ngastroesophageal reflux disease\nobstruction or blockage of the digestive tract, which may be caused by conditions such as colorectal, ovarian, or stomach cancer\nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

People with certain health conditions\u00a0may need to follow a special diet. Your doctor may refer you to a registered dietitian\u00a0to help create a healthy eating plan. Check on the cost of a dietitian\u2019s services and whether your health insurance may pay for some or all of these services.\nChanging your eating and drinking habits\nYour doctor may suggest changing your eating and drinking habits to reduce gas symptoms. For example, doctors may recommend\navoiding or limiting how often you chew gum, suck on hard candy, drink fizzy drinks, and drink with a straw\navoiding talking while eating or drinking\neating slowly and, when possible, sitting down to eat instead of eating on the run\neating smaller, more frequent meals instead of larger meals\nSome people have more gas symptoms when they consume certain carbohydrates\u00a0that the stomach\u00a0and small intestine\u00a0don\u2019t fully digest. When these carbohydrates reach the large intestine, bacteria\u00a0break them down and create gas in the process.\nExamples of foods and drinks containing carbohydrates that may lead to excess gas include\ncertain fruits\u2014including apples, peaches, and pears\u2014and fruit juices\nvegetables, especially cruciferous vegetables\u2014a group that includes broccoli, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, and others\u2014and legumes\u2014a group that includes beans, peas, and lentils\ndairy products, such as milk, ice cream, and yogurt\nwhole grains, such as whole wheat\ndrinks that contain high-fructose corn syrup, such as fruit juices, soft drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks\ncandy, gum, or other products that contain sweeteners ending in \u201c\u2013ol,\u201d such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, and maltitol\nSome people have more gas symptoms when they consume too much fiber. Others may have more gas symptoms when they eat high-fat foods, which can increase bloating.\nTalk with your doctor about your diet. Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of what you eat and drink and your gas symptoms. The diary can help your doctor or dietitian figure out whether certain foods and drinks could be causing your gas symptoms.\nFollowing a special diet to help treat health conditions\nIf you are diagnosed with a health condition that could be causing your gas symptoms, your doctor or dietitian may recommend a special diet. For example, health care professionals may recommend\nfollowing a gluten-free diet to treat celiac disease.\nreducing the amount of lactose\u00a0in your diet to manage symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nreducing the amount of fructose, especially high-fructose corn syrup, in your diet to manage symptoms of dietary fructose intolerance.\ntrying a low FODMAP\u00a0diet for a few weeks to see if it helps with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.

    "content": "Bloating happens when your abdomen (belly) enlarges and feels full and tight. Your stomach may even look like it\u2019s sticking out.\nFeeling \"too full\" is common. Between 10% and 30% of people experience bloating. Many conditions cause it, which can make finding the reason a challenge.\nFor instance, you might feel bloated because of:\nConstipation (less than three bowel movements per week)\nGut sensitivity or IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)\nDiet choice or food sensitivities\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)\nIssues with your ovaries or uterus\nCeliac disease (an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten)\nInflammatory bowel disease (inflammation of your digestive tract)\nGastroparesis (slow emptying of the stomach into the small intestine)\nHere's a look at some of these in more detail.\nThe most common way you get gas into your gut is to swallow it. Everyone gets gas in their intestines when they eat, but some people\u2019s bodies react more severely to it, which can cause bloating.\nMany gastrointestinal (GI) conditions can lead to bloating, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis, and constipation. One study showed that 96% of people with IBS have bloating.\nVery few bacteria usually live in your small intestine (where food mixes with digestive juices).But if food moves too slowly through this area, bacteria can linger and start to ferment. This can lead to bloating.\nIf you feel really bloated during your period, the drop in progesterone and estrogen levels may be the reason.\nSome medicines cause bloating as a side effect. Among them are aspirin, fiber supplements, and certain pain relievers.\nCancers of the stomach, ovary, colon, and pancreas can have bloating as a symptom.\nOnce the cause of your bloating has been found, your doctor can suggest some ways to manage it. Among the treatments they may advise you to try:\nThis type of medication can help with bloating caused by food. It allows gas to pass more easily through your digestive tract.\nSimethicone helps you pass gas bubbles trapped in your intestines.\nAlpha-galactosidase breaks down the carbohydrates in vegetables and beans.\nActivated charcoal may reduce gas symptoms, but research hasn't shown a clear benefit. It could interfere with other medications, so check with your doctor before taking it.\nLactase supplements help you digest the sugar lactose in dairy products.\nPhysical activity can help clear gas from your body. Some studies show that yoga especially can be a safe way to reduce not only bloating, but belly pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Try gentle poses that stimulate digestion like:\nWind relieving pose: Lie on your back and bring your knees to your chest. Place your hands on the top of your shins. Inhale and move your knees away from you. Exhale and draw your knees back into your chest.\nVirasana (hero pose): Kneel on the floor with your knees touching. (If this is uncomfortable, place a yoga block or small stack of books underneath your sitting bones.) The tops of your feet should be flat on the floor or yoga mat. Sit tall, breathing deeply for a few breaths.\nChild's pose: Kneel on the floor with your knees touching. Bring your toes together and spread your knees wide. Lower your torso between your thighs so your forehead rests on the floor. Relax your neck and straighten your arms overhead.\nAmong the home remedies you can try to reduce bloating are:\nSeveral kinds may benefit your gut health. For instance:\nPeppermint has a long history as a digestive aid in folk medicine. Studies show that tea brewed from plant leaves and peppermint oil may relax your GI muscles. That could help with bloating.\nGinger is another herb that may help with upper GI symptoms like bloating and constipation. Look for ginger tea at the store, or make your own by soaking a few peeled pieces of fresh ginger in boiling water for at least 10 minutes.\nTurmeric is a bright orange-yellow spice that's well-known in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. It has anti-inflammatory powers. To make a tea: add 2 teaspoons of turmeric powder to 1-2 cups of boiling water, simmer for 5 minutes, then strain. High doses of turmeric can interfere with some medications, so ask your doctor before you try it.\nChamomile has been used for hundreds of years. Some studies show that this medicinal plant may relax your digestive tract. It could also relieve gas, indigestion, and diarrhea. Allergies to chamomile are rare, but you're more likely to have a reaction if you're allergic to ragweed.\nFennel is used around the world for a number of ailments. Compounds in it appear to help relax the smooth muscles of your intestine and reduce gas.\nDandelion may help clear extra fluids from your body by causing you to pee more. But more studies need to be done.\nLet your doctor know before you start using any herbs or herbal teas.\nGently massaging your belly can relieve bloating by softening your stomach muscles and speeding up digestion. It's generally safe unless you're pregnant, have a belly wound, or live with a condition that affects your spine.\nWarmth on your belly can help soothe cramping muscles. Try a hot water bottle or heating pad, or take a warm bath.\nEating too quickly causes you to swallow more air, which can lead to gas and bloating. Try to eat slowly, chewing each bite carefully. Mindful eating can make it easier to realize when you're full. Eating smaller, more frequent meals is another way you can try to cut back on bloat.\nIf you notice certain foods causing you to bloat, try cutting back or avoiding them. Common culprits include wheat, beans, lentils, garlic, onions, and asparagus. Milk and dairy foods can also cause bloating if you have a hard time digesting lactose.\nStomach bloating often happens when poorly digested carbohydrates begin to ferment in your colon. Many people find that a low-FODMAP diet helps.\nA low-FODMAP diet cuts out some or all of the following:\nOligosaccharides: found in legumes, onions, garlic, wheat\nDisaccharides: such as lactose and found in dairy\nMonosaccharides: such as fructose and found in apples, pears, and honey\nPolyols: found in most stone fruits, cauliflower, chewing gum, and candies\nOne option is to remove FODMAP foods that you suspect of creating bloat one at a time. Or you could try an elimination diet, removing all FODMAP foods and then slowly adding them back to see how they affect you. A food diary can help you keep track.\nConstipation can also cause stomach bloating, so a diet high in fiber can help with both conditions. If you have at least one of the following symptoms, you may be constipated:\nIncomplete or infrequent bowel movements\nStraining to start or complete bowel movements\nDrinking more water can help. You might also add kiwifruit to your diet, which has proven helpful in cases of bloating and constipation.\nIn some cases, your doctor can prescribe a medication to reduce bloating and other GI symptoms. For instance:\nCertain kinds of antidepressants can prevent your body from overreacting to gas.\nAntispasmodics help reduce bloating as well as cramping and gas.\nRifaximin is an antibiotic approved by the FDA for IBS treatment. A short course can help symptoms like bloating that may be caused by too much \"bad\" bacteria in your gut.\nEating fiber can help prevent constipation and reduce bloating. But eating too much is one of the most common reasons for bloating. The key is to eat fiber in moderate amounts. If you're just starting to eat more fiber-rich foods like beans, lentils, broccoli, whole wheat, apples, berries, or quinoa, add them slowly to your diet. That way, your system can get used to them.\nMany people use probiotics (live \"good\" bacteria) to help with digestive issues. There's some evidence that taking them can help reduce stomach bloating, but more studies are needed to figure out which strains are most helpful.\nOver-the-counter enzymes can help you digest two foods that often cause bloating: dairy and legumes (such as beans).\nIf you have a hard time digesting the sugars in these foods, you might try lactase supplements for dairy or alpha-galactosidase supplements for beans and other legumes.\nWhen you chew gum, you're swallowing more air, which can lead to bloating and burping. Sucking on hard candy has the same effect.\nSalt causes your body to hang on to extra fluids, which can make your belly feel full and tight. To cut back, try to eat less fast food or processed food that comes in a box, can, or bag. They tend to contain a lot of salt.\nBiofeedbackis a technique that helps you learn how to control some of your body functions, like your breathing and heart rate. It may help with IBS symptoms, but more studies need to be done.\nMost stomach bloating will resolve on its own. But see a doctor if it doesn't go away or if you notice any of the following:\nChange in stool color, consistency, and frequency\nUnexplained loss of appetite or feeling of being \"too full\"\nIf you're an older person who doesn\u2019t usually have bloating and you suddenly have it for more than a few days, your doctor will want to rule out other more severe conditions.\nEveryone feels bloated and \"too full\" sometimes. Often, it can be treated at home and prevented by watching the foods you eat. But if bloating's an ongoing issue, talk to your doctor to rule out a more serious cause.\nBloating and pregnancy can both make your belly look full. Pregnancy can also cause constipation and indigestion, which are also causes of bloating.\nIf you think that you may be pregnant, take a test to find out and follow up with your doctor.",

    "content": "Reviewed by \nRobert H. Shmerling, MD, \n \n Senior Faculty Editor, Harvard Health Publishing; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing\nGut health is an easy thing to take for granted \u2014 or to ignore completely, if everything is generally functioning well. But poor gut health can impact your overall health in a variety of ways, from the obvious (stomach discomfort) to less obvious effects on mood and immune function.\nPeople are talking about gut health and their microbiome more than they used to, but if it's not something that comes up around your dinner table, here are some basics.\nWhen people talk about their gut microbiome, they're referring to all the microorganisms (both good and bad) living in your gastrointestinal tract (primarily your large intestine). Most people have hundreds \u2014 or even thousands \u2014 of different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in their gut.\nGut diversity is important because different microorganisms may help support health in a variety of ways, including:\nimproved digestion and nutrient absorption\nprotection against harmful bacteria\nPlus, a healthy and diverse gut microbiome may help reduce your risk of conditions including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, some cancers, GI disorders, and cardiovascular disease.\nThe good news is that you can take steps to support a healthy gut microbiome.\nFiber serves as a prebiotic, or food for the good bacteria that live in your gut. Eating plenty of fiber is associated with increased microbial diversity and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal issues like constipation and Crohn's disease. Fiber helps keep the colon healthy by reducing inflammation; it also helps keep you regular.\nHowever, most of us don't get enough fiber. Aim to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods including legumes, whole grains, avocados, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, tofu, berries, leafy greens, and nuts and seeds.\nWater is critical for healthy digestion. It helps your body absorb and transport nutrients; it helps with keeping your core body temperature steady; it aids in the production of mucus to protect your digestive tract; and it helps prevent constipation. When you become constipated, your gut microbiota changes, becoming less abundant. If you become dehydrated, your body will let you know, as not drinking enough can manifest as thirst, headache, dry mouth, less frequent urination, dizziness, and tiredness. So drink up \u2014 around four to six cups per day for most people.\nIncreased stress often manifests itself in digestive discomfort. Stress causes hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to spike, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. This gut-brain connection is powerful; it's why we get butterflies before a big presentation, or feel nauseous when we're in a high-stakes situation. And while we can't avoid stressful situations entirely, it's possible to learn to manage stress through techniques like belly breathing, relaxation therapy, and meditation.\nHealthier gut, better sleep? Perhaps, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology, which found that certain bacteria in your gut may impact your sleep in a variety of ways, from your likelihood of experiencing insomnia, to how frequently you need to nap, to how long you stay asleep at night. Most people should aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. If you're struggling to hit that goal, try improving your sleep hygiene, getting plenty of daytime exercise, and trying some of the stress management tips above.\nIt's not hard to find good reasons tostay active, but here's one more: According to a systematic review published in Nutrients, participating in 150 to 270 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise per week for at least six weeks has a positive effect on your gut microbiota, particularly if you combine aerobic exercise with resistance training. We already know that people who are sedentary have different gut microbiota characteristics than active people; this research suggests that you might be able to improve your gut health through exercise even if you're not currently active.\nLindsay Warner, \n Content Licensing Editor, Harvard Health Publishing\nRobert H.

    "content": "Pay attention to your gut-brain connection \u2013 it may contribute to your anxiety and digestion problems\nThe gut-brain connection is no joke; it can link anxiety to stomach problems and vice versa. Have you ever had a \"gut-wrenching\" experience? Do certain situations make you \"feel nauseous\"? Have you ever felt \"butterflies\" in your stomach? We use these expressions for a reason. The gastrointestinal tract is sensitive to emotion. Anger, anxiety, sadness, elation \u2014 all of these feelings (and others) can trigger symptoms in the gut.\nThe brain has a direct effect on the stomach and intestines. For example, the very thought of eating can release the stomach's juices before food gets there. This connection goes both ways. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person's stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause\u00a0or\u00a0the product of anxiety, stress, or depression. That's because the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system are intimately connected.\nThis is especially true in cases where a person experiences gastrointestinal upset with no obvious physical cause. For such functional GI disorders, it is difficult to try to heal a distressed gut without considering the role of stress and emotion.\nGiven how closely the gut and brain interact, it becomes easier to understand why you might feel nauseated before giving a presentation, or feel intestinal pain during times of stress. That doesn't mean, however, that functional gastrointestinal conditions are imagined or \"all in your head.\" Psychology combines with physical factors to cause pain and other bowel symptoms. Psychosocial factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as symptoms. In other words, stress (or depression or other psychological factors) can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract.\nIn addition, many people with functional GI disorders perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. Stress can make the existing pain seem even worse.\nBased on these observations, you might expect that at least some patients with functional GI conditions might improve with therapy to\u00a0reduce stress\u00a0or treat anxiety or depression. Multiple studies have found that psychologically based approaches lead to greater improvement in digestive symptoms compared with only conventional medical treatment.\nGut-brain connection, anxiety and digestion\nAre your\u00a0stomach or intestinal problems\u00a0\u2014 such as heartburn, abdominal cramps, or loose stools \u2014 related to stress? Watch for these and other common symptoms of stress and discuss them with your doctor. Together you can come up with strategies to help you deal with the stressors in your life, and also ease your digestive discomforts.\nImage:\u00a0\u00a9 ChrisChrisW | GettyImages\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

    "content": "Reviewed by \nHoward E. LeWine, MD, \n \n Chief Medical Editor, Harvard Health Publishing; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing\nOur gastrointestinal tracts contain about 100 trillion microorganisms, mainly bacteria. These organisms are collectively known as the gut microbiome.\nThe vast majority of bacteria in our microbiome are good. Good bacteria's primary role is to counterbalance the bad kind to keep your gut healthy. They offer other health benefits as well.\nBut sometimes the balance between good and bad bacteria gets disturbed. That's where probiotics come in. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts. They replenish your gut with more good bacteria to restore the balance between good and bad bacteria.\nLesser known, but also important to maintaining a balanced microbiome, are prebiotics.\nPrebiotics are ingredients in certain foods that your intestines can't fully digest. Examples of prebiotics include some starches, oligosaccharides, inulin, and pectin. They tend to be most plentiful in high-fiber foods.\nPrebiotics work in tandem with probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that maintain or improve the balance of good to bad bacteria in your digestive system. Some examples of foods that contain probiotcs are yogurt, kimchi, many cheeses, pickles, kombucha, and sauerkraut.\nPrebiotics, on the other hand, act as nutrition for gut bacteria, helping them to flourish. When bacteria are fed what they need to stay healthy, they keep our bodies healthy in return.\nPotential health benefits of prebiotics\nPrebiotic foods can improve your gut microbiome and enhance your health. Experts are still learning more about the benefits of prebiotics. But research has found a link between higher prebiotic intake and\nimproved intestinal absorption of dietary calcium\na well-functioning immune system\na reduce risk of colorectal cancer.\nThe role of prebiotics may extend beyond being a food source within your microbiome, too. One recent study showed that people who consumed 30 grams daily for two weeks of foods high in a plant-based prebiotic called inulin were more likely to select medium- to low-calorie foods over high-calorie ones.\nFurthermore, their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods. The study suggests that eating prebiotic foods might help people make healthier dietary choices.\nPrebiotic foods to add to your diet\nPrebiotics are found in a variety of high-fiber grains, vegetables, and fruits. Some of the best prebiotic foods include:\nwheat and whole-grain products such as cereals and breads.\nEating more prebiotic food is not a good idea for everyone. For example, some people with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find a diet heavy in prebiotics worsens their symptoms. On the other hand, people who struggle with constipation may find improved bowel function with prebiotics.\nFinding the right balance of prebiotic food that works for you is key. Starting slowly and gradually increasing prebiotic foods can help avoid possible digestive discomfort.\nLisa Catanese, ELS, \n Health Writer\nHoward E.

    "title": "What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?",
    "content": "The gut-brain connection is complex and bidirectional. Signals pass both ways between your digestive system and central nervous system, and health or disease in one can affect the other. Key players in this connection include your enteric nervous system, your vagus nerve and your gut microbiome.\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nWhat is the gut-brain connection?\nYour brain talks to your gut, and your gut talks back. If you\u2019ve ever had a \u201cgut feeling,\u201d you\u2019ve experienced this communication. It\u2019s how the thought of an exciting event can make you feel \u201cbutterflies in your stomach,\u201d while the thought of something dreadful might be \u201cgut-wrenching.\u201d And it\u2019s how the feeling in your gut can influence your decision-making, as in \u201cgoing with your gut\u201d.\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nYour brain communicates with all of your body through nerves (your nervous system). But your brain and your gut are like besties. They talk about all kinds of things, from practical, physical matters to emotional ones. More information passes between your brain and your gut than any other body system. In fact, there are more nerve cells in your gut than anywhere else in your body outside of your brain.\nWhat is the purpose of the gut-brain connection?\nOur brains and digestive systems have evolved together to help us survive. What we eat is crucial to our overall health, and it has also varied a lot throughout history, depending on what was available. Our brains and guts needed to stay in close contact to make sure we got the nutrients we needed. And if we ate the wrong thing, or we needed to put the brake on digestion, we had to have a good alarm system in place.\nThis alarm system includes the emotional part of your brain. After a physical injury, your emotional brain kicks in to help you remember to avoid that injury in the future. Emotion can make physical sensations in your gut seem more intense. Intense physical sensations can also raise your stress levels and your emotional response. This feedback loop is especially strong between your brain and gut.\nWhat types of body functions does the gut-brain connection affect?\nStudies suggest that crosstalk between your gut and brain may influence your:\nFood sensitivities and intolerances.\nGut motility (muscle movements).\nWhat body systems are involved in the gut-brain connection?\nWhat healthcare providers refer to as the gut-brain axis is the network of nerves that connect your brain and gut and send signals back and forth. But your nervous system also works closely with your endocrine system, which produces hormones that communicate things like hunger, fullness and stress. And it works closely with your immune system to respond appropriately to injury or disease in your gut.\nWithin this network, some of the key players in the gut-brain connection include:\nYour enteric nervous system is the neural network that operates within your gastrointestinal (GI) tract and controls its digestive functions. With more than 500 million neurons, it\u2019s the most complex neural network outside of your brain. It\u2019s also unique in that it can operate somewhat independently from your brain and central nervous system. This has led some scientists to refer to it as a \u201csecond brain\u201d.\nYour enteric nervous system is a special division of your autonomic nervous system, which governs the automatic functions of your internal organs. It operates as part of your overall autonomic nervous system, but also on its own. It can gather information about the conditions inside your GI tract, process that information locally and generate a response without sending it back to your brain.\nYour vagus nerve is the main link between your enteric nervous system and your brain. It\u2019s one of your 12 cranial nerves, which begin in your cranium and travel down through your body, branching out along the way. Your vagus nerve conveys sensory information about the conditions inside your gut from your enteric nervous system to your brain. In response, it conveys motor signals from your brain to your gut.\nThe vagus nerve mediates various reflexes that operate within your gut in response to changing conditions, like chemical changes or the presence of food. These are called vagal reflexes. Intrinsic vagal reflexes operate within your enteric nervous system without involving your brain. Extrinsic reflexes operate through communication between your enteric nervous system and central nervous system.\nBelieve it or not, the bacteria that live in your gut are also involved in your gut-brain connection. Gut microbes produce or help produce many of the chemical neurotransmitters that convey messages between your gut and brain. They also produce other chemicals that can affect your brain through your bloodstream. Your brain and gut, in turn, can affect your gut microbiome by altering its environment.\nRecent studies have shown that the gut microbiome may be involved in various neurological, mental health and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Functional disorders are those that cause persistent symptoms but don\u2019t have any obvious physical cause. There\u2019s a significant overlap among people who have functional gastrointestinal disorders, like IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), and who have mental health disorders, like anxiety.\nWhat types of medical conditions or symptoms might involve the gut-brain axis?\nDisorders related to the gut-brain axis may include:\nIrritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation or diarrhea.\nAnxiety and depressive disorders.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders, like autism.\nNeurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nNerve-related pain disorders, like multiple sclerosis.\nHow do healthcare providers treat disorders of the gut and brain?\nHealthcare providers are experimenting with treating some of these disorders by treating your gut microbiome. Animal experiments have suggested that a healthier diversity of microbiota in your gut may help to relieve gastrointestinal, neurological, inflammatory and emotional stress symptoms. Results in humans are still mixed, but intriguing. They might treat your gut microbiome in several ways, including:\nFecal microbiota transplantation.\nPeople with certain functional gastrointestinal disorders may benefit from mind-body therapy with a behavioral medicine specialist. Several different types of therapies may be beneficial in relieving persistent GI symptoms, or at least learning to cope with them. They can also help improve your overall mood and stress levels, which may help your gut indirectly. Some of these therapies include:\nRelaxation therapy. This approach uses different techniques to help you relax and reduce your automatic reactions to stress. Techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, visualization and restful music. Research suggests these therapies are most effective when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The goal of this approach is to help people with GI disorders change their thoughts, behavior and emotional responses in relation to physical pain as well as mental/emotional stress and anxiety.\nGut-directed relaxation training. This is a combination of deep relaxation with positive suggestions focused on GI function. An example would be placing your hands on your abdomen while being asked to feel warmth and imagine having control over your GI function. This approach may be helpful for people whose symptoms occur even without obvious stress.\nBiofeedback. This therapeutic training teaches a person how to control automatic body responses. An example would be learning how to control your heart rate or temperature with the assistance of an electronic device that provides feedback on these functions. Research has shown that biofeedback, in combination with other stress and symptom management techniques, has produced positive health effects in people with functional GI disorders.\nWhat can I do at home to nurture my gut-brain axis?\nThe best way you can take care of your gut health on a day-to-day basis \u2014 and maybe your brain health, as a result \u2014 is by maintaining a healthy, balanced diet. You can also take care of your brain health \u2014 and maybe, through it, your gut health \u2014 by doing what you can to manage your stress. Here are some ways to manage stress during intense times, and ways to relieve stress in your day-to-day life.\nWhat type of diet is good for my gut-brain axis?\nA good rule of thumb to improve your gut health naturally is to eat a good variety of whole foods, emphasizing plants. More diversity in your diet leads to a more diverse gut microbiome, which is good for your overall gut health. Whole foods and plants also pack more nutrition per calorie than processed foods, leaving less room for harmful additives, sweeteners and saturated fats. Instead, they offer:\nSoluble and insoluble fiber. Most plants have both kinds of fiber, which help keep your bowels regular and feed the helpful microbiota inside. These microbes, in turn, nourish your gut lining.\nPrebiotics and probiotics. Probiotics are the live bacteria in fermented foods, like yogurt and sauerkraut. Prebiotics are the fibers and complex starches that these bacteria like to eat.\nAntioxidants. Antioxidants, which occur naturally in a variety of fruits and vegetables, help to fight free radicals in your body and prevent inflammation. Different foods have different types.\nAnti-inflammatory foods. A whole-food, plant-rich diet is naturally anti-inflammatory because it reduces sugar, additives and cholesterol. This helps keep your gut microbes happy.\nYour gut and brain are in constant communication through nerves and chemical signals. They\u2019re so close that they can feel each other\u2019s pain. If you have a condition that affects your digestive system or nervous system, it may also involve the other. Healthcare providers are beginning to approach these conditions from both sides of the gut-brain axis. You can, too, by taking care of your mental health and gut health.\nIf you have issues with your digestive system, you need a team of experts you can trust.

    "title": "Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications",
    "content": "From embarrassing gas to uncomfortable heartburn, everyone has digestive problems from time to time. The good news is there are some simple solutions for many of your troubles. Learn about what causes your discomfort, how to prevent and manage digestive problems, what questions to ask your pharmacist, and when to see a doctor.\nHow does the\u00a0digestive system work?\nIt may seem like digestion only happens in your\u00a0stomach, but it\u2019s a long process that involves many organs. Together they form the digestive tract.\nDigestion begins in your mouth, where\u00a0saliva starts to break down food when you chew. When you swallow, your chewed food moves to your\u00a0esophagus, a tube that connects your throat to your\u00a0stomach. Muscles in the esophagus push the food down to a valve at the bottom of your esophagus, which opens to let food into the stomach.\nYour stomach breaks food down using stomach acids. Then the food moves into the small intestine. There, digestive juices from several organs, like your\u00a0pancreas and\u00a0gallbladder, break down the food more, and nutrients are absorbed. What\u2019s left goes through your large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water. The waste then moves out of your body through the rectum and\u00a0anus.\nDigestive problems can happen anywhere along the way.\nBloating and\u00a0passing gas can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nGas is a normal part of healthy digestion. Air that is in your digestive tract is either released through your\u00a0mouth as a burp or through your anus as gas. You typically pass gas 13 to 21 times a day.\nGas is created when you swallow air, such as when you eat and drink. But it\u2019s also a byproduct of the breakdown of food. Some foods cause more gas than others. You may also be more sensitive to particular foods and may have more gas when you eat them.\nTaking some\u00a0medications can also cause gas.\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed you feel gassy after eating certain foods. Cut back on the common culprits:\nWhen gas builds up in your stomach and\u00a0intestines, you may have bloating \u2013 swelling in your belly and a feeling of fullness. It may happen to you more often if you have:\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This digestive condition causes\u00a0stomach pain, cramping, and diarrhea or\u00a0constipation.\nCeliac disease. When people with this condition eat gluten, their bodies produce antibodies that attack the intestinal lining.\nHormonal changes that happen around women\u2019s periods\nWhile bloating is usually just uncomfortable, it can sometimes\u00a0cause pain in your belly or sides.\nHow can I reduce gas and bloating?\nDiet and lifestyle changes can make a big difference:\nAvoid sweeteners that cause gas such as fructose and\u00a0sorbitol. They are often found in candies, chewing gum, energy bars, and low-carb foods.\nWhat OTC medicines treat excess gas?\nIf you have a lot of gas or are very uncomfortable, an over-the-counter medicine may help.\nLactase\u00a0supplements. If dairy is causing your problems, taking these tablets or drops just before you eat will help you digest lactose (the main sugar in dairy foods) and reduce gas.\nAlpha-galactosidase. This digestive aid comes as liquid or tablets. You take it before you eat to help your body break down the complex carbs or sugars that cause gas, such as those found in beans, broccoli, and cabbage. Caution: People with the genetic condition galactosemia should avoid it. It may also interfere with some diabetes drugs like\u00a0acarbose (Precose) or\u00a0miglitol (Glyset). If you take medication for\u00a0diabetes, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this aid.\nSimethicone (Mylicon).\u00a0Taking these liquids or tablets can relieve the uncomfortable bloating and pain from gas.\nProbiotics. These supplements contain \"friendly\" bacteria that can help digestion. In addition to tablets and powders you sprinkle on your food, foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut contain\u00a0probiotics.\nHeartburn, sometimes called acid\u00a0indigestion, is a painful, burning feeling in the middle of your chest or the upper part of your stomach. The pain, which can also spread to your neck, jaw, or arms, can last just a few minutes or stick with you for hours.\nThere\u2019s a muscle at the entrance of your stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), that acts like a gate: It opens to let food move from your esophagus to your stomach, and it shuts to stop food and acid from coming back out.\nWhen the LES opens too often or isn\u2019t tight enough, stomach acid can rise up into the esophagus and cause the burning feeling.\nTriggers vary from person to person, but you may be more likely to get heartburn when you:\nEat spicy, fatty, acidic, or greasy foods\nSome people have a higher risk of heartburn, including those who are:\nHave a\u00a0hiatal hernia, where the stomach bulges up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm\nHow should I change my diet to avoid heartburn?\nYou might have noticed that your heartburn gets worse when you eat or drink certain things. Here are a few that can\u00a0trigger heartburn:\nOranges, lemons, and other citrus fruits and juices\nVinegar, hot sauces, and salad dressings\nBig meals can also set off heartburn. Instead of eating three big meals a day, try to eat several small meals throughout the day.\nWhat else can I do to prevent heartburn?\nLose weight if you\u2019re\u00a0overweight. Extra pounds put pressure on your stomach, forcing more acid up into your esophagus.\nWear loose clothing. Tight clothes that press on your stomach can trigger heartburn.\nIf you smoke, quit. Cigarette smoke relaxes the muscle that prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus. It also may increase how much acid your stomach makes.\nCheck your medicines. Regular use of anti-inflammatory and pain medicines (other than\u00a0acetaminophen) contributes to heartburn.\nIf heartburn bothers you at night:\nEat a light dinner and avoid foods that trigger your heartburn.\nDon\u2019t lie down for at least 2 to 3 hours after you eat.\nUse blocks or books to raise the head of your bed by 4-6 inches. Or put a foam wedge under your mattress at the head of the bed. Sleeping at an angle will help stop acid from backing up into your esophagus.\nExercise has more than a few health perks. Among them is weight loss, which can help you avoid getting heartburn in the first place if you are overweight. But some types of exercise can trigger the burning sensation. You\u2019ll be less likely to reach for your heartburn medicine if you avoid crunches and inverted poses in\u00a0yoga. You may need to find alternatives to high-impact workouts. For example, bicycle or swim instead of going for a run.\nEveryone has heartburn from time to time. But when you have it frequently (at least twice a week for a few weeks), or when it begins to interfere with your daily life or damage your esophagus, your doctor may tell you that you have a long-term condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It\u2019s also known as\u00a0acid reflux disease. Heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD.\nWhat are other symptoms of GERD?\nBesides the frequent burning in your chest, you might also have symptoms like:\nBad breath or a sour taste in your\u00a0mouth or in the back of your throat\nFeeling like you have a lump in the back of your throat\nDifficult or painful swallowing\nFrequent heartburn is a symptom of GERD. It\u2019s important to get help if you have heartburn frequently so you can avoid complications from GERD and uncover any other problems. Call your doctor or make an appointment with a gastroenterologist, who specializes in digestive illnesses.\nMany of the\u00a0symptoms of heartburn sound like a\u00a0heart attack. If you\u2019re not sure, call 911.\nWhat are the complications of frequent heartburn and GERD?\nOver time, heartburn that isn\u2019t treated or controlled well by lifestyle changes or medicine may cause serious problems, including:\nBreathing problems like asthma, nighttime choking, and repeated pneumonia\nChanges in the cells that line the esophagus, called Barrett\u2019s esophagus. This can possibly lead to\u00a0cancer of the esophagus.\nPainful\u00a0inflammation of the esophagus called\u00a0esophagitis\nNarrowing of the esophagus, called an esophageal stricture. This can cause problems swallowing.\nWhat medicines can I take to treat heartburn?\nSeveral types of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicines can help with heartburn. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you find the one that\u2019s right for you.\nWhat type of antacid should I choose?\nSoothe occasional, mild heartburn with an antacid that contains\u00a0calcium carbonate or\u00a0magnesium. They help neutralize stomach acid. Some prevent acid reflux. Those that contain magnesium may also help heal stomach ulcers. They come in liquids and pills and are fast-acting.\nWhat are the side effects of antacids?\nAntacids can cause\u00a0constipation and diarrhea. Look for brands that contain\u00a0calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and aluminum hydroxide to reduce these side effects. Don\u2019t take antacids with magnesium if you have chronic kidney disease. Some antacids have a lot of salt, so you should take them only for occasional heartburn.\nH2 blockers help relieve and prevent occasional heartburn by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Though they don\u2019t work as fast as antacids, their effects last longer. Your doctor may tell you to take an antacid and an H2 blocker together. H2 blockers are for short-term use \u2013 less than 2 weeks. You can take them before your meals to prevent heartburn, or at\u00a0bedtime. They come in liquids and pills.\nAll H2 blockers work about the same. So if one doesn\u2019t help with your heartburn, switching to a different one isn\u2019t likely to help. Switching to a higher-dose prescription version of the drug might help, though. Talk to your doctor if over-the-counter H2 blockers aren't working for you.\nSome H2 blockers can interfere with other drugs, including:\nMedicines for\u00a0heart rhythm problems\nTalk to your doctor if you take any of these medicines and you need to take an H2 blocker.\nWhat are the side effects of H2 blockers?\nThe most common side effects are mild and include:\nPPIs are used to prevent frequent heartburn that happens more than twice a week. They work by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Often, they work better than H2 blockers. You also can take these drugs for a longer period of time than H2 blockers.\nPPIs are available over the counter and by prescription. But if you have GERD, you may need prescription-strength medication.\nYou need to take PPIs once a day on an empty stomach so they\u2019ll work best. Usually you\u2019ll take the medicine every morning, about 30 to 60 minutes before you eat\u00a0breakfast, to control stomach acid.\nTalk to your doctor before taking the PPI called\u00a0omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) if you take\u00a0clopidogrel (Plavix), a drug used to prevent\u00a0heart attacks and strokes. Taking the two drugs may make clopidogrel less effective.\nWhat are the side effects of PPIs?\nThe most common side effects are mild and include:\nPPIs may also raise your chances of getting kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine, and may lead to low magnesium levels. The risk is highest in people who take high dose PPIs for a year or more.\nProkinetics help your stomach empty faster, so you have less acid left behind. Usually you take this medicine before meals and at\u00a0bedtime.\nProkinetics are sold only by prescription.\nWhat are the side effects of prokinetics?\nProkinetics can have more serious side effects than PPIs or H2 blockers. These include:\nYes. If your heartburn isn\u2019t getting better, your medicines cause side effects you can\u2019t tolerate, or you have other complications, you may need surgery. It is rare to need surgery for heartburn.\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. It can be helpful to keep a journal to note what you eat and drink and when you have heartburn. This will help you and your doctor pinpoint your triggers.\nIf medicine and lifestyle changes don\u2019t control your heartburn, you can take one of these tests to find out what's causing the problem:\npH test.\u00a0This measures the acidity of your esophagus. The doctor will either attach a small sensor to your esophagus or place a thin tube down your esophagus.\nEndoscopy.\u00a0A long, thin tube with a camera and light on the end is put down your esophagus so your doctor can look inside your esophagus and stomach. Endoscopy can look for problems such as an ulcer or narrowing inside your esophagus.\nBarium X-ray.\u00a0You\u2019ll drink a liquid that coats the inside of your digestive tract. Then X-rays are taken, which will allow your doctor to see the outline of your\u00a0digestive system.\nWhen is heartburn an emergency?\nHeartburn is usually a minor problem that goes away over time. But if you also have other symptoms, it could be a sign that something more serious is wrong. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if:\nYou have black, tarry-looking\u00a0bowel movements.\nYour mouth or throat hurts when you eat.\nYou have difficulty swallowing foods\nYour vomit contains\u00a0blood or what looks like coffee grounds.\nIs it heartburn or a\u00a0heart attack?\nHeartburn doesn\u2019t affect your\u00a0heart, but it can feel a lot like the\u00a0chest pain that happens during a heart attack. Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms along with chest pain, even if you\u2019re not sure that you\u2019re having a heart attack:\nPain that travels to your neck and\u00a0shoulder, jaw, or back\nOver-the-Counter Heartburn Relief\nThey may cause constipation, diarrhea,\u00a0headache, nausea, or vomiting.\nThey may cause diarrhea,\u00a0headache, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. They may also cause kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine\nHow do I know if I\u2019m constipated?\nWhat\u2019s considered a normal number of bowel movements varies from person to person. If you are straining when going to the bathroom, you are probably constipated. You may also have hard stools or a feeling that your bowel movement isn\u2019t complete.\nOccasional constipation is common, but if you have less than three bowel movements in a week, see your doctor.\nThere are many causes of constipation, and sometimes you have more than one:\nTraveling or changing your routine\nTaking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, iron, and some pain medications (particularly narcotic pain medications)\nMedical conditions including cancer, diabetes, IBS, and hypothyroidism\nBlockages in the large intestine\nProblems with the nerves or muscles around the large intestine or rectum\nIf you are constipated for more than 2 weeks, are losing weight, have blood in your stool, or you are having severe pain, see your doctor. These may be signs of a serious problem.\nHow can I prevent and treat constipation without medication?\nDrink plenty of water (60-80 ounces per day). An extra two to four glasses a day may help.\nEat prunes or bran cereal to get 20-35 grams of fiber per day.\nDrink warm wateror herbal tea in the morning.\nWhat OTC medications can I take for constipation?\nWhen lifestyle changes don\u2019t solve your problems, there are several over-the-counter medications that can help. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about which medicine is right for you. Be sure to read labels carefully before taking these medicines. Using some over-the-counter treatments for constipation for more than 2 weeks can make your symptoms worse and may be a sign of something more serious.\nBulk-forming laxatives. You take these fiber supplements with water to bulk up your stool, which can trigger your bowels to push it out. Some common bulk laxatives are\u00a0methylcellulose, polycarbophil, psyllium, and wheat dextrin.\nLubricants, like mineral oil. They coat the surface of the intestine and block water from being absorbed from the stool, which helps it pass more easily.\nOsmotic agents. These help keep more water in the intestine, which can expand the intestine and stimulate a bowel movement. Osmotic agents are not for some older adults and people with heart or kidney failure. Talk to your doctor before taking this type of medicine.\nStool softeners. By adding fluid to stools, softeners help you avoid straining and make them easier to pass.\nStimulants. These laxatives make the intestines contract, which helps move the stool.\nSuppositories or enemas. Some laxatives come in a form that can be inserted into the rectum. These are helpful when you have to avoid straining, such as after surgery or childbirth.\nHemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum and the anus, and they can be uncomfortable. They can be either inside the rectum (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). Internal hemorrhoids usually don\u2019t cause discomfort, though straining to have a bowel movement may cause them to bleed or lead to spasms in the muscles of the rectum, which can be painful. External hemorrhoids itch and may bleed.\nWhat are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?\nBleeding during a bowel movement\nSwelling or pain around the anus\nPainful or sensitive lumps around the anus\nIf you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. Bleeding can also be a symptom of something more serious.\nConstipation or straining during bowel movements causes most hemorrhoids. You may also have hemorrhoids if you don't get enough fiber in your diet.\nBeing pregnant or overweight can cause hemorrhoids because of the extra pressure on your rectum. Hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy can also weaken the muscles of the rectum and anus.\nYou\u2019re also more likely to get them if you sit for long periods of time. And they're more common as you get older. Other causes include having diabetes, a past rectal surgery, and colon cancer.\nIf you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. They can recommend treatment and make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition.\nYou should also see your doctor if your hemorrhoids haven\u2019t gotten better with treatment. You may need to see a doctor who specializes in hemorrhoids.\nHow can I treat hemorrhoids without medication?\nAdd fiber to your diet to help relieve constipation and make your stools softer. This will make it easier to have bowel movements and reduce the pressure on hemorrhoids.\nExercise to help relieve constipation.\nDon\u2019t strain during bowel movements.\nSoak in a plain, warm bath or sitz bath (a few inches of water that covers your private parts and bottom) to help relieve the pain.\nUse moist wipes instead of dry toilet paper so you don\u2019t irritate the area any further.\nApply an ice pack or cold compress to help with swelling.\nAvoid spicy foods to prevent itching.\nWhich OTC medications treat hemorrhoids?\nMedications include creams, suppositories, pads, and ointments. Most products contain witch hazel or hydrocortisone, which can help stop the itching and swelling and may ease pain. Most over-the-counter medications should not be used for more than a week. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about which is the best option for you.\nDiarrhea is loose, watery stool that sends you to the bathroom more often than usual. When you have diarrhea, you may have stomach pain and cramps or bloating.\nMany things cause diarrhea, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, medications, and medical conditions that affect the stomach, intestines, or colon. What you eat can also be a culprit.\nIf you have occasional, mild diarrhea, there is probably no reason for concern. But if it lasts for more than 2 days and hasn\u2019t improved, you should call your doctor. If your infant or child has diarrhea, call your pediatrician.\nYou should also call your doctor if you have diarrhea along with any of these symptoms:\nDehydration. Signs of dehydration include feeling very thirsty, having a dry mouth or skin, having little or no urine, having dark yellow urine, and feeling weak.\nDrink plenty of fluids (water, sports drinks, fruit juice) to keep from getting dehydrated. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and dairy. If you aren\u2019t nauseated, you can eat plain, bland, low-fiber foods including bananas, plain white rice, toast, and crackers.\nAs long as you don\u2019t have other symptoms that worry you, you may also try some over-the-counter treatments:\nLoperamide (Imodium): This comes in liquid and capsules. It works by slowing movement in your intestines and colon so you can absorb more water, making the stool less watery. Talk to your doctor about taking this medicine. Do not give it to children under 2.\nBismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol,\u00a0Pink Bismuth): This medicine reduces mild diarrhea and comes in liquids, capsules, and chewable tablets. You shouldn\u2019t take it if you\u2019re allergic to aspirin or have a fever. Don\u2019t give it to children under 2. If you\u2019re taking a blood thinner, don\u2019t take this medicine before talking to your doctor.\nProbiotics: The same supplements that can help with bloating from gas may also help relieve some types of diarrhea by adding \u201cgood\u201d bacteria to your digestive system.\nFiber is a natural part of plants. There are two types. Both are important and work in different ways.\nSoluble fiber dissolves in water, turning into a gel. Think of it as a sponge, soaking up fluid. Soluble fiber can help with diarrhea, which happens when there is too much water in your colon. It also slows the emptying of your stomach so you feel fuller longer, which can help you lose weight.\nInsoluble fiber doesn\u2019t dissolve in water. Think of it as a broom: It helps keep food and waste moving through your body. Because insoluble fiber attracts water in your gut, it makes stools softer and easier to pass. Eating a diet rich in insoluble fiber can help with constipation.\nWomen should get about 25 grams of fiber per day. Men should get 38 grams.\nIf you have trouble getting enough fiber from foods, your doctor may suggest you take fiber supplements.\nWater is essential to good health and normal bowel function. Water also helps keep stools soft but solid and well-formed. Avoid drinking beverages such as coffee or soda if you think they trigger your digestive problems.\nYour digestive tract is full of different kinds of bacteria. You may think that is a bad thing, but most of the bacteria in your gut are healthy. They break down toxins, help your body make some vitamins, and play a role in keeping you healthy. But when you have too much of some kinds of bacteria, you may get an illness or have unpleasant symptoms.\nProbiotics are like the healthy bacteria in your body. Eating foods that contain them, or taking probiotic supplements, can help keep a balance of good and bad bacteria in your body.\nExperts aren\u2019t sure exactly how they work, but probiotics may help:\nPrevent harmful bacteria from growing in your stomach\nDestroy the bacteria that make you sick\nMake B vitamins your body needs\nWhich foods contain probiotics?\nYogurt with live, active cultures\nShould I take a probiotic supplement?\nPeople with certain conditions shouldn\u2019t take them, and some probiotics may affect how well your other medications work. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about whether probioticsupplements are right for you.",

    "title": "Bloating 101: Why You Feel Bloated",
    "content": "Bloating, gassiness, and abdominal discomfort aren\u2019t limited to the occasional holiday feast. It can happen even if you haven\u2019t eaten a large meal. In some cases, bloating can even cause distention, or a perceptible swelling of the abdomen.\nBloating and gas are usually not signs of a serious health problem. They're tied to what and how you eat, so a few simple changes may help.\nHere are three common causes of bloating, and how you can avoid them.\nOvereating is probably the most common cause of bloating. Smaller portions should ease the pain.\nEating rich and fatty food can make you feel uncomfortably stuffed. Fat takes longer to digest than protein or carbohydrates, so it keeps the stomach full longer. Avoid bloating by limiting fats in your everyday diet.\nEating too fast adds to the risk of bloating after a meal. The remedy is simple -\u2011 eat more slowly. Satiety signals can take up to 20 minutes to reach the brain and ease your appetite. Many weight loss experts believe that eating slowly helps prevent overeating.\nThe second most common cause of temporary bloating is gas in the abdomen. About half of gas in the digestive system is swallowed air. The rest is produced by bacteria in the gut that help digest food. If the gastrointestinal tract does not move it through efficiently, gas builds up in the intestines, causing bloating and discomfort.\nIf you often experience bloating caused by gas, avoid these habits that make you swallow more air:\nSome people swallow more air when they\u2019re nervous. It\u2019s possible that practicing ways to reduce stress and anxiety, such as breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation, may help reduce excess gas and bloating.\nDifficult-to-digest foods can cause gassiness and bloating. These are some familiar culprits.\nBeans and lentils are very healthy foods that contain indigestible sugars called oligosaccharides. These sugars must be broken down by bacteria in the intestines.\nFruits and vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, prunes, and apricots. These items contain sugars and starches that may cause gassiness and bloating, even though these foods are good for you.\nSweeteners can also cause gas and bloating. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener, can\u2019t be digested. Fructose, a natural sugar added to many processed foods, is hard for many people to digest. To avoid bloating, be aware of these sweeteners in the foods you eat and limit the amount you consume.\nDairy products can be a source of intestinal distress and bloating if you have trouble digesting lactose, or milk sugar.\nWhole grains, recommended for their many health benefits, can sometimes cause bloating and gas problems. One reason whole grains are so healthy is their high fiber content. But fiber is an indigestible carbohydrate. Abruptly increasing the amount of fiber you eat can cause gas, bloating, and constipation. Nutritionists recommend slowly adding more fiber into your diet to allow your body time to adjust. At the same time, drink plenty of water with high-fiber foods, says nutritionist Joanne L. Slavin, PhD, RD, professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota. \u201cAll fiber absorbs water,\u201d she says. Drinking liquids helps fiber move through the digestive system and prevents bloating and constipation.\nWhen to Ask Your Doctor About Bloating\nTemporary bloating is common and nothing to worry about. But if you\u2019re troubled by bloating on a regular basis, talk to your doctor.\nPhysical obstructions such as scarring of the stomach opening can make it hard for food to pass through the digestive tract normally. If your doctor diagnoses a physical obstruction in the stomach or small intestines, surgery may be needed to correct it. Bloating can also be caused by impaired muscle function in the digestive tract. When muscles that normally move food along don\u2019t work properly, gas can build up in the small intestines, causing bloating. In some cases, gas in the intestines may go the wrong way, returning to the stomach.\nPersistent bloating or distention may also signal potentially serious conditions, such as enlargement of one of the abdominal organs or a malignancy.\nWhat Else You Can Do About Bloating\nIf eliminating or reducing consumption of hard-to-digest foods doesn\u2019t solve your frequent bloating problem, there are over-the-counter medications that might help. Look for a pill or liquid containing alpha-D-galactosidase, an enzyme that breaks down indigestible sugars in beans and vegetables. Tablets or capsules containing simethicone can also help alleviate symptoms of excess gas.\nIf you smoke, intestinal distress may be one more reason to quit. Smoking has been linked to bloating, heartburn, and other digestive problems.\nFortunately, bloating is rarely a symptom of serious trouble. For most people, the most effective prescription for bloating is simple: control portion sizes, go easy on fats, and eat slowly enough to give your body time to signal when you\u2019ve had enough. These sensible remedies should keep you from feeling overstuffed and bloated.",

    "title": "Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat",
    "content": "Prebiotics are types of fiber that feed your friendly gut bacteria. Here are 19 healthy foods rich in prebiotics.\nPrebiotics allow your gut bacteria to produce nutrients for your colon cells, which leads to a healthier digestive system.\nSome of these nutrients include short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which can be absorbed into your bloodstream and improve metabolic health.\nHowever, prebiotics shouldn\u2019t be confused with probiotics, which are live bacteria found in certain foods or supplements.\nRead on to explore 19 healthy prebiotic foods to add to your grocery list.\nChicory root is a great source of prebiotics.\nApproximately 68% of chicory root fiber comes from the prebiotic fiber inulin, which is a compound that helps improve digestion and bowel function and helps relieve constipation.\nThe greens of dandelion flowers can be cooked or consumed raw.\nThey contain fiber, a high portion of which also comes from inulin.\nThe Jerusalem artichoke \u2014 also known as the sunroot, sunchoke, or earth apple \u2014 is part of the sunflower family. It, too, contains inulin-rich dietary fiber.\nAlong with its other benefits, inulin helps increase the friendly bacteria in your colon, promoting greater digestive health. It can also aid in the absorption of minerals in your large intestine.\nGarlic is a flavorful herb linked to various health benefits.\nGarlic acts as a prebiotic by promoting the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria in the gut. It also helps prevent disease-promoting bacteria from growing.\nOnions have many health benefits. They are also rich in inulin, as well as fructooligosaccharides (FOS).\nFOS is a type of carbohydrate that helps strengthen gut flora and helps with fat breakdown.\nLeeks come from the same family as onions and garlic, and they offer similar health benefits.\nLeeks are nutrient-dense, which means they\u2019re low in calories but high in vitamins and minerals. Thanks to their inulin content, leeks promote healthy gut bacteria and help break down fat.\nAsparagus is a popular vegetable and another great source of prebiotics. Like other foods on this list, this nutritious vegetable naturally contains inulin.\nBananas also contain some inulin. Unripe (green) bananas are also high in resistant starch, which has prebiotic effects.\nIn addition, bananas contain a variety of other compounds beneficial to health.\nBarley contains beta-glucan, which is a prebiotic fiber.\nBeta-glucan in barley has been shown to lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It may also help lower blood sugar levels.\nWhole oats are a healthy grain with prebiotic benefits. Like barley, they contain beta-glucan fiber, as well as resistant starch. Oats also contain various phytochemicals that act as prebiotics.\nResearch also suggests that in addition to their prebiotic properties and their positive impact on healthy gut bacteria, they have other health benefits, such as helping lower cholesterol.\nApples contain pectin, a type of soluble fiber with prebiotic benefits.\nPectin increases butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that feeds beneficial gut bacteria and decreases the population of harmful bacteria. However, more research is needed to fully explore the benefits of pectin in humans.\nKonjac root, also known as elephant yam, is a tuber \u2014 or a vegetable grown underground, like the potato.\nFlour made from this tuber contains 70% to 90% of a highly viscous dietary fiber called glucomannan fiber, which can act as a prebiotic by promoting the growth of good gut bacteria. It also has many other health benefits.\nCocoa beans are seeds from the Theobrama cacao tree used to make chocolate. Cocoa powder makes it easy to add cocoa to oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, and other recipes.\nCocoa is a rich source of polyphenols, such as flavanols, which exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds also help grow beneficial gut bacteria while reducing the growth of harmful bacteria.\nBurdock root is a vegetable commonly used in Japan and has proven health benefits.\nBurdock root is rich in inulin and FOS, which support the growth of healthy bacteria in the digestive tract. It also also contains phenolic compounds.\nFlaxseeds are a great source of prebiotics.\nThe fiber in flaxseeds promotes healthy gut bacteria and encourages regular bowel movements. They also contain phenolic antioxidants.\nYacon root is a vegetable very similar to sweet potatoes that is rich in fiber.\nIt is particularly rich in prebiotic FOS and inulin. It also contains phenolic compounds that give it antioxidant properties.\nJicama root is low in calories and high in fiber, including the prebiotic fiber inulin.\nIn older animal research, jicama root was shown to help improve digestive health, enhance insulin sensitivity, and lower blood sugar levels.\nWheat bran is the outer layer of the whole wheat grain. It contains a special type of fiber made of arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS).\nIn animal research, AXOS fiber from wheat bran has been shown to boost healthy Bifidobacteria in the gut.\nIn humans, wheat bran has also been shown to help increase the presence of Bifidobacterium in fecal matter, which leads to softer stools in healthy individuals whose digestion was slow.\nSeaweed is a form of marine algae rich in prebiotics, as well as other healthy compounds.\nLab studies have shown that polysaccharides found in seaweed can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which nourish the cells lining your gut.\nHowever, more human research is needed to explore the full benefits of seaweed.\nLike apples, avocados contain pectin, which has prebiotic properties.\nResearch suggests that eating avocadoes regularly can help decrease the levels of bile acids in the feces, increase levels of healthy fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids, and lead to a higher presence of good gut bacteria.\nPrebiotic foods are high in special types of fiber that support digestive health.\nThey promote the increase of friendly bacteria in the gut, help with various digestive problems, and even boost your immune system.\nPrebiotic foods have also been shown to improve metabolic health and even help prevent certain diseases.\nSince the fiber content of these foods may be altered during cooking, try to consume them raw rather than cooked to gain the full health benefits.\nWith a variety of options available, you can take your time to find the best prebiotic foods for yourself and your gut.",

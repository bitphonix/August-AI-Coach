"The bacteria and other microbes in your gut help you digest food and may support immune, heart, and brain health, among other benefits. Your body is full of trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi. They are collectively known as the microbiome. While some bacteria are associated with disease, others are actually extremely important for your immune system, heart, weight and many other aspects of health. This article serves as a guide to the gut microbiome and explains why it’s so important for your health. Bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microscopic living things are referred to as microorganisms, or microbes, for short. Trillions of these microbes exist mainly inside your intestines and on your skin. Most of the microbes in your intestines are found in a “pocket” of your large intestine called the cecum, and they are referred to as the gut microbiome. Although many different types of microbes live inside you, bacteria are the most studied. In fact, there are more bacterial cells in your body than human cells. There are roughly 40 trillion bacterial cells in your body and only 30 trillion human cells. That means you are more bacteria than human (1, 2). What’s more, there are up to 1,000 species of bacteria in the human gut microbiome, and each of them plays a different role in your body. Most of them are extremely important for your health, while others may cause disease (3). Altogether, these microbes may weigh as much as 2–5 pounds (1–2 kg), which is roughly the weight of your brain. Together, they function as an extra organ in your body and play a huge role in your health. The gut microbiome refers to all of the microbes in your intestines, which act as another organ that’s crucial for your health.",How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,296,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-microbiome-and-health,How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,2025-09-03T02:37:01.195886,www.healthline.com
"Humans have evolved to live with microbes for millions of years. During this time, microbes have learned to play very important roles in the human body. In fact, without the gut microbiome, it would be very difficult to survive. The gut microbiome begins to affect your body the moment you are born. You are first exposed to microbes when you pass through your mother’s birth canal. However, new evidence suggests that babies may come in contact with some microbes while inside the womb (4, 5, 6). As you grow, your gut microbiome begins to diversify, meaning it starts to contain many different types of microbial species. Higher microbiome diversity is considered good for your health (7). Interestingly, the food you eat affects the diversity of your gut bacteria. As your microbiome grows, it affects your body in a number of ways, including: Digesting breast milk: Some of the bacteria that first begin to grow inside babies’ intestines are called Bifidobacteria. They digest the healthy sugars in breast milk that are important for growth (8, 9, 10). Digesting fiber: Certain bacteria digest fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids, which are important for gut health. Fiber may help prevent weight gain, diabetes, heart disease and the risk of cancer (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17). Helping control your immune system: The gut microbiome also controls how your immune system works. By communicating with immune cells, the gut microbiome can control how your body responds to infection (18, 19). Helping control brain health: New research suggests that the gut microbiome may also affect the central nervous system, which controls brain function (20). Therefore, there are a number of different ways in which the gut microbiome can affect key bodily functions and influence your health.",How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,291,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-microbiome-and-health,How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,2025-09-03T02:37:01.197780,www.healthline.com
"The gut microbiome affects the body from birth and throughout life by controlling the digestion of food, immune system, central nervous system and other bodily processes. The Gut Microbiome May Affect Your Weight There are thousands of different types of bacteria in your intestines, most of which benefit your health. However, having too many unhealthy microbes can lead to disease. An imbalance of healthy and unhealthy microbes is sometimes called gut dysbiosis, and it may contribute to weight gain (21). Several well-known studies have shown that the gut microbiome differed completely between identical twins, one of whom had obesity and one of whom did not. This demonstrated that differences in the microbiome were not genetic (22, 23). Interestingly, in one study, when the microbiome from the twin with obesity was transferred to mice, they gained more weight those that had received the microbiome of the other twin, despite both groups eating the same diet (22). These studies show that microbiome dysbiosis may play a role in weight gain. Fortunately, probiotics are good for a healthy microbiome and can help with weight loss. Nevertheless, studies suggest that the effects of probiotics on weight loss are probably quite small, with people losing less than 2.2 pounds (1 kg) (24). Gut dysbiosis may lead to weight gain, but probiotics can potentially restore gut health and help reduce weight. The microbiome can also affect gut health and may play a role in intestinal diseases like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (25, 26, 27). The bloating, cramps and abdominal pain that people with IBS experience may be due to gut dysbiosis. This is because the microbes produce a lot of gas and other chemicals, which contribute to the symptoms of intestinal discomfort (28).",How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,292,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-microbiome-and-health,How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,2025-09-03T02:37:01.197780,www.healthline.com
"However, certain healthy bacteria in the microbiome can also improve gut health. Certain Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which are found in probiotics and yogurt, can help seal gaps between intestinal cells and prevent leaky gut syndrome. These species can also prevent disease-causing bacteria from sticking to the intestinal wall (29, 30). In fact, taking certain probiotics that contain Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli can reduce symptoms of IBS (31). A healthy gut microbiome controls gut health by communicating with the intestinal cells, digesting certain foods and preventing disease-causing bacteria from sticking to the intestinal walls. The Gut Microbiome May Benefit Heart Health Interestingly, the gut microbiome may even affect heart health (32). A recent study in 1,500 people found that the gut microbiome played an important role in promoting “good” HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (33). Certain unhealthy species in the gut microbiome may also contribute to heart disease by producing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO is a chemical that contributes to blocked arteries, which may lead to heart attacks or stroke. Certain bacteria within the microbiome convert choline and L-carnitine, both of which are nutrients found in red meat and other animal-based food sources, to TMAO, potentially increasing risk factors for heart disease (34, 35, 36). However, other bacteria within the gut microbiome, particularly Lactobacilli, may help reduce cholesterol when taken as a probiotic (37). Certain bacteria within the gut microbiome can produce chemicals that may block arteries and lead to heart disease. However, probiotics may help lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. It May Help Control Blood Sugar and Lower the Risk of Diabetes The gut microbiome also may help control blood sugar, which could affect the risk of type 1 and 2 diabetes. One recent study examined 33 infants who had a genetically high risk of developing type 1 diabetes.",How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,300,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-microbiome-and-health,How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,2025-09-03T02:37:01.197780,www.healthline.com
"It found that the diversity of the microbiome dropped suddenly before the onset of type 1 diabetes. It also found that levels of a number of unhealthy bacterial species increased just before the onset of type 1 diabetes (38). Another study found that even when people ate the exact same foods, their blood sugar could vary greatly. This may be due to the types of bacteria in their guts (39). The gut microbiome plays a role in controlling blood sugar and may also affect the onset of type 1 diabetes in children. The gut microbiome may even benefit brain health in a number of ways. First, certain species of bacteria can help produce chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. For example, serotonin is an antidepressant neurotransmitter that’s mostly made in the gut (40, 41). Second, the gut is physically connected to the brain through millions of nerves. Therefore, the gut microbiome may also affect brain health by helping control the messages that are sent to the brain through these nerves (42, 43). A number of studies have shown that people with various psychological disorders have different species of bacteria in their guts, compared to healthy people. This suggests that the gut microbiome may affect brain health (44, 45). However, it’s unclear if this is simply due to different dietary and lifestyle habits. A small number of studies have also shown that certain probiotics can improve symptoms of depression and other mental health disorders (46, 47). The gut microbiome may affect brain health by producing brain chemicals and communicating with nerves that connect to the brain. How Can You Improve Your Gut Microbiome? There are many ways to improve your gut microbiome, including:",How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,282,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-microbiome-and-health,How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,2025-09-03T02:37:01.197780,www.healthline.com
"Eat a diverse range of foods: This can lead to a diverse microbiome, which is an indicator of good gut health. In particular, legumes, beans and fruit contain lots of fiber and can promote the growth of healthy Bifidobacteria (48, 49, 50, 51). Eat fermented foods: Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kefir all contain healthy bacteria, mainly Lactobacilli, and can reduce the amount of disease-causing species in the gut (52). Limit your intake of artificial sweeteners: Some evidence has shown that artificial sweeteners like aspartame increase blood sugar by stimulating the growth of unhealthy bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae in the gut microbiome (53). Eat prebiotic foods: Prebiotics are a type of fiber that stimulates the growth of healthy bacteria. Prebiotic-rich foods include artichokes, bananas, asparagus, oats and apples (54). Breastfeed for at least six months: Breastfeeding is very important for the development of the gut microbiome. Children who are breastfed for at least six months have more beneficial Bifidobacteria than those who are bottle-fed (55). Eat whole grains: Whole grains contain lots of fiber and beneficial carbs like beta-glucan, which are digested by gut bacteria to benefit weight, cancer risk, diabetes and other disorders (56, 57). Try a plant-based diet: Vegetarian diets may help reduce levels of disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli, as well as inflammation and cholesterol (58, 59). Eat foods rich in polyphenols: Polyphenols are plant compounds found in red wine, green tea, dark chocolate, olive oil and whole grains. They are broken down by the microbiome to stimulate healthy bacterial growth (60, 61). Take a probiotic supplement: Probiotics are live bacteria that can help restore the gut to a healthy state after dysbiosis. They do this by “reseeding” it with healthy microbes (62).",How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,288,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-microbiome-and-health,How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,2025-09-03T02:37:01.197780,www.healthline.com
"Take antibiotics only when necessary: Antibiotics kill many bad and good bacteria in the gut microbiome, possibly contributing to weight gain and antibiotic resistance. Thus, only take antibiotics when medically necessary (63). Eating a wide variety of high-fiber and fermented foods supports a healthy microbiome. Taking probiotics and limiting antibiotics can also be beneficial. Your gut microbiome is made up of trillions of bacteria, fungi and other microbes. The gut microbiome plays a very important role in your health by helping control digestion and benefiting your immune system and many other aspects of health. An imbalance of unhealthy and healthy microbes in the intestines may contribute to weight gain, high blood sugar, high cholesterol and other disorders. To help support the growth of healthy microbes in your gut, eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fermented foods.",How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,140,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-microbiome-and-health,How Does Your Gut Microbiome Impact Your Overall Health?,2025-09-03T02:37:01.197780,www.healthline.com
"Your gut microbiome is a microscopic world within the world of your larger body. The trillions of microorganisms that live there affect each other and their environment in various ways. They also appear to influence many aspects of your overall health, both within your digestive system and outside of it. Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Policy A biome is a distinct ecosystem characterized by its environment and its inhabitants.

Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Your gut microbiome is unique to you. Infants inherit their first gut microbes during vaginal delivery or breastfeeding. Later, your diet and other environmental exposures introduce new microbes to your biome. Some of these exposures can also harm and diminish your gut microbiota. Why is the gut microbiome important? Most of the microorganisms in our guts have a symbiotic relationship with us, their hosts. That means we both benefit from the relationship. We provide them with food and shelter, and they provide important services for our bodies. These helpful microbes also help to keep potentially harmful ones in check.",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,249,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.496999,my.clevelandclinic.org
"You can think of your gut microbiome as a diverse native garden that you rely on for nutritious foods and medicines. When your garden is healthy and thriving, you thrive, too. But if the soil is depleted or polluted, or if pests or weeds are overrunning the helpful plants, it can upset your whole ecosystem. What does your gut microbiome do? Your gut microbiome interacts with many of your body systems and assists with many body functions. It plays such an active role in your body that some healthcare providers have described it as being almost like an organ itself. Some of these interactions we’re still learning about, while others are well known. Bacteria in your gut help break down certain complex carbohydrates and dietary fibers that you can’t break down on your own. They produce short-chain fatty acids — an important nutrient — as byproducts. They also provide the enzymes necessary to synthesize certain vitamins, including B1, B9, B12 and K. These might seem like small nutrients, but micronutrient deficiencies can have a big impact on your health. (See: vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency and vitamin K deficiency.) Short-chain fatty acids, in particular, feed the cells in your gut lining and help to keep your overall gut environment healthy. Gut bacteria also help to metabolize bile in your intestines. Your liver sends bile to your small intestine to help you digest fats. When that’s done, bacteria and their enzymes help to break it down so that the bile acids can be reabsorbed and recycled by your liver. This is called enterohepatic circulation.",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,263,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.496999,my.clevelandclinic.org
"If this process stopped working, your body would be unable to recycle bile acids and your liver wouldn’t have enough to produce new bile. Your digestive system wouldn’t get the bile it needs to digest and absorb fats. And leftover cholesterol, one of the components of bile, would build up in your blood. Beneficial microbes in your gut help to train your immune system to tell them apart from the unhelpful, pathogenic types. Your gut is your largest immune system organ, containing up to 80% of your body’s immune cells. These cells help to clear out the many pathogens that pass through it every day. Helpful gut microbes also compete directly with unhelpful types for real estate and nutrients, preventing them from taking up too much territory. Some of the chronic bacterial infections that can affect your GI tract, including C. difficile and H. pylori, are directly related to having a diminished gut microbiome. Short-chain fatty acids, the byproducts of helpful gut bacteria, have important benefits for your immune system. They help maintain your gut barrier, keeping the bacteria and bacterial toxins inside from escaping into your bloodstream. They also have anti-inflammatory properties for your gut. Inflammation is a function of your immune system, but it can malfunction, becoming hyper-reactive. Chronic inflammation is a feature of autoimmune disease and may have a role in many other diseases, including cancer. Short-chain fatty acids appear to suppress these types of inflammatory reactions. Gut microbes can affect your nervous system through the gut-brain axis — the network of nerves, neurons and neurotransmitters that runs through your GI tract. Certain bacteria actually produce or stimulate the production of neurotransmitters (like serotonin) that send chemical signals to your brain.",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,284,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.496999,my.clevelandclinic.org
"Bacterial products may also affect your nervous system. Short-chain fatty acids appear to have positive effects, while bacterial toxins might damage nerves. Researchers continue to investigate how your gut microbiome might be involved in various neurological, behavioral, nerve pain and mood disorders. Gut microbes and their products also interact with endocrine cells in your gut lining. These cells (enteroendocrine cells) make your gut the largest endocrine system organ in your body. They secrete hormones that regulate aspects of your metabolism, including blood sugar, hunger and satiety. Researchers continue to explore how your gut microbiome might be involved in metabolic syndrome (obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes) and excess fat storage in your liver. These conditions have some relationship with certain gut microbiota, although exactly what it is isn’t clear yet. Your “gut” roughly refers to your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Most people use it to mean your intestines. You have some gut microbiota in your stomach and small intestine, but most of them are in your large intestine (colon). They float around inside or attach to the mucous lining on the inner walls (mucosa). The types of gut bacteria that live in your colon are different from the types that live elsewhere. They’re mostly anaerobic bacteria that require a low-oxygen environment to survive. The higher oxygen, faster movement and strong digestive juices in your upper GI tract prevent them from colonizing there. Anaerobic gut bacteria perform important functions within your colon that only they can. They help break down indigestible fibers in your digestive tract and produce essential nutrients that you can’t get otherwise. By the same token, these organisms are only helpful to you within their natural microbiome.",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,279,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.496999,my.clevelandclinic.org
"If these bacteria stray beyond your colon, they can be harmful. Colon bacteria that manage to creep up and settle in your small intestine can interfere with digestive processes there. Colon bacteria that invade your colon wall, or that escape through a wound in your colon wall, can cause an infection in your body. Healthcare providers use the term “dysbiosis” to refer to an unbalanced or unhealthy gut microbiome. A loss or deficit of beneficial bacteria. Overgrowth of potentially pathogenic (bad) bacteria. Loss of overall bacterial diversity. Dysbiosis may start with one of these three factors, but the others tend to soon follow. A loss of beneficial bacteria leaves your gut vulnerable to more disease-causing or invasive types. These types can overrun the other microorganisms living there, diminishing the overall diversity in your microbiome. What environmental factors affect your gut microbiome? Just like a garden, your gut microbiome is affected by the nutrients and pollutants, pests and weeds it’s exposed to. The diversity of plants and their different seasons or life cycles also affect it. In your gut, this means your diet, chemical exposures, disease-causing organisms and bowel movement regularity. The variety of microorganisms in your gut microbiome requires a variety of plant fibers to thrive. Different organisms prefer different whole foods. In turn, they produce short-chain fatty acids and other byproducts that nourish your gut and lower the pH inside, which favors the more beneficial microbes. On the other hand, a diet high in sugar and saturated fats tends to favor the less helpful types of microorganisms. Processed foods not only lack fiber and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) but also tend to come with many additives and preservatives, which can be harmful to your microbiome.",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,286,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.496999,my.clevelandclinic.org
"Chemicals that may poison your microbiome include environmental toxins like alcohol, tobacco smoke and pollutants. Additionally, pesticides like antibiotics can wipe out the good bacteria along with the bad. Other medications, like acid blockers, can affect your microbiome by changing the pH inside. Your gut microbiome can usually recover from temporary chemical exposure, like a brief prescription for a medication you need to get well. But chronic exposure can affect its composition. If you take certain medications or use substances like alcohol frequently, it may prevent certain microbes from thriving. In a healthy gut microbiome, different types of microorganisms support each other. Consider how different plants in a garden cross-pollinate or nourish the soil for each other. For example, some types feed other types by breaking down compounds, or their byproducts change the acidity of the “soil.” On the other hand, a microbiome that doesn’t support a healthy variety of microorganisms is more vulnerable to being overrun by the invasive types. Without healthy competition, these “weeds” and “pests” take over the habitat and deplete the resources that the other types need to survive. Your motility is the regular movement of your bowels. This is how your “crop” of microorganisms turns over. After traveling through your colon, where they help break down undigested compounds into nutrients you can absorb, many come out with your poop. How long this takes affects your microbiome. The movement of food and waste through your GI tract helps to distribute different microbes into different places along the way. If it’s too fast, they don’t have time to settle or to do their jobs before clearing out. But if it’s too slow, they can overeat and overgrow, spreading beyond their territory. What health conditions and disorders relate to my gut microbiome?",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,294,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.496999,my.clevelandclinic.org
"Conditions directly related to gut dysbiosis include: Infections. Invasive pathogens (disease-causing organisms) can cause temporary or chronic infections in your gut. They can cause diarrhea, inflammation (colitis) and toxic damage to your gut lining. Some types even directly invade your gut barrier, threatening to escape into your bloodstream and go systemic. Dysbiosis weakens your gut’s defenses against these pathogens. SIBO. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is dysbiosis in your small intestine. It means certain types of bacteria there are overgrown, using too many resources and producing too many byproducts. In some cases, bacteria from your large intestine have migrated and settled in your small intestine, where they don’t really belong. This can be a result of slow gut motility. Inflammatory bowel disease. IBD is a collection of autoimmune conditions in your gut that includes ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis and Crohn’s disease. Gut dysbiosis is one of the criteria for diagnosing IBD. Researchers still aren’t sure which comes first, but they know the two conditions are related and that each contributes to the other, making it worse. Atherosclerosis. Certain less-desirable gut bacteria contribute to your cardiovascular risk by producing a byproduct called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). This byproduct builds up in your arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis (hardening of your arteries). It’s one of the substances that cardiac blood tests check for when determining your risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Other conditions that may be indirectly related to gut dysbiosis include: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

"Many commercial labs offer gut microbiome testing kits to consumers. You can send a poop sample to a lab, and they’ll send you back a report telling you a little bit about the composition of your gut microbiome. Clinical healthcare providers generally don’t use or recommend these tests, though. The reason is that we still don’t know enough about the different types of gut microbiota or how they affect our health to make a report like this useful. There’s a lot of exciting research in progress, but it has some ways to go before a gut microbiome test can give you practical, personalized healthcare advice. How do healthcare providers test for gut dysbiosis? Healthcare providers don’t check for dysbiosis, per se, but they can check for specific conditions, like infections and bacterial overgrowth. They may use blood tests, stool tests or breath tests. A breath test can measure different gases in your breath that are the byproducts of certain bacteria in your gut. How do healthcare providers treat gut microbiome conditions? Some medical treatments for your gut microbiome include: Elimination diet. An elimination diet is a short-term diet designed to isolate the foods causing your gastrointestinal symptoms. These are often foods that your gut microbes like to eat. When too many microbes are eating too many of these foods, they produce too many byproducts, causing intestinal gas, diarrhea and other symptoms. Starving them is one way to reduce them. Antibiotics. If you have an infection or overgrowth of a certain gut bacteria, the standard treatment is a course of antibiotics. When that’s done, a healthy gut microbiome can recover. But some people’s guts will need a little help recovering. Healthcare providers might suggest following with supplements like prebiotics and probiotics to help restore your microbiome.",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,295,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.497978,my.clevelandclinic.org
"Fecal transplant. One treatment for restoring a severely diminished gut microbiome is fecal transplantation, which means transferring a sampling of gut microbiota from a healthy gut to a diseased one. So far, it’s only been approved to treat recurrent C. diff infections that are resistant to antibiotics. But researchers are looking into it as a treatment for other conditions. What can I do to take care of my gut microbiome? A healthy diet and lifestyle encourages a healthy gut microbiome. For example: Improve your gut health naturally with a diverse and plant-rich diet. Aim for a variety of whole foods like whole grains, vegetables and fruits. These offer plenty of dietary fiber for your gut microbes as well as micronutrients for you. These foods also reduce inflammation in your gut, which affects the environment inside. Processed and convenience foods do the opposite. Try probiotics and prebiotics. You can get probiotics and prebiotics in supplement form, or from foods. Probiotics are helpful microbes that you can ingest, through supplements or fermented foods, that’ll take up residence in your colon. Your healthcare provider can help you pick the best probiotic for you. Prebiotics are the dietary fibers that feed your helpful gut bacteria. Use antibiotics with care. There are times when you need to take antibiotics, but other times when you really don’t. Overuse of antibiotics in the general population leads to antibiotic resistance. In the individual, it can kill your good bacteria along with the bad. Sometimes this disrupts the balance in your gut microbiome, leading the wrong kind to come back stronger.",What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,262,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome,What Is Your Gut Microbiome?,2025-09-03T02:37:04.497978,my.clevelandclinic.org

Policy But how are those connections made between your gut and the rest of your body, and what does gut health actually mean? Let’s plunge right in. Your gastrointestinal (GI) tract (also known as your digestive tract) is the largest part of your digestive system. Composed of a series of connected hollow organs that run from your mouth to your anus (think of it like a long tube), it includes your esophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. When you eat food or drink liquid, your body breaks those items down into nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, etc.) as they travel through your digestive tract. Those nutrients are then used to fuel your body’s various biological cycles and processes. You have to consume nutrients in order to stay alive. And when those nutrients are broken down, the microorganisms living inside of your small and large intestines go to work to put those nutrients to use. So, your gut health refers to the health of your entire digestive system and the health of the microorganisms living in your digestive tract. Need more info?

"According to digestive disease researcher and registered dietitian Gail Cresci, PhD, RD, and registered dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick, RD, there are more than 100 trillion microbes inside of your body, with many of them living inside of your small and large intestines. This area, known as your gut microbiome, plays a role in your body’s ability to digest food, metabolize nutrients and reduce inflammation. This story from gastroenterologist Bret Lashner, MD, sums up nine weird facts you may not have known about your gut, like how your stomach acid is strong enough to burn your skin and how you have detergents in your intestines. Who would’ve guessed? Balance is key — especially when it comes to making sure you have enough good bacteria to counteract the bad bacteria in your gut. Probiotics are just that: They’re beneficial microbes that support the number of good bacteria you have so they can get the job done. You’ll find probiotics in foods and supplements, but you’ll also find specific probiotics that can help with specific conditions. Dr. Cresci explains how to choose the right probiotics for you. Prebiotics are a whole other thing. If you think about probiotics as farm animals that produce a variety of products that work for you, then prebiotics are the foods and nutrients that keep your farm animals (in this case, good bacteria) healthy and strong.

"You can experience a build-up of gas as a byproduct of your gut microbiota breaking down all the nutrients you’ve consumed. This is why you may want to tread softly into probiotic and fiber territory, or you’ll end up feeling bloated and gassy. Luckily, Beth Czerwony, RD, has this list of foods that help soften your bloat. We can’t stress this enough: The more stressed you are, the higher your chances of causing harm to your immune system and overall physical and mental health. Plus, your gut microbiome is responsible for 70% to 80% of your immune system. Registered dietitian nutritionist Courtney Barth, RDN, explains how eating these foods helps reduce inflammation and cortisol levels in your body, which all have a hand in stress, so your immune system can be maintained. It’s important to keep things moving, especially when your food has a long way to go before it gets fully processed. But if you’re constipated, you could experience a backup that results in cramps or intense stomach pain. These home remedies from gastroenterologist Samita Garg, MD, can help with constipation by keeping your gut happy and making sure you stay regular. The function of your gut is vast, so of course, when something goes wrong, it can be hard to tell exactly what’s causing problems. If you’re having issues with your digestive system or experiencing any pain, you should see a healthcare provider for testing and treatment that’s specific to your case — but this story on digestion troubles from gastroenterologist Brian Baggott, MD, can help you parse out some details on exactly what might be causing you some discomfort.",What You Should Know About Your Gut Health,272,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health,What You Should Know About Your Gut Health,2025-09-03T02:37:08.699767,health.clevelandclinic.org

"How To Improve Your Gut Health Naturally Eating a diet heavy on plant-based food can keep your digestive system in top form If you’ve got a bad feeling in your belly, it’s best to pay attention. What’s happening in your digestive tract can set the tone for your whole day. (Remember the last time you battled diarrhea? Yeah … that’s what we’re talking about.) Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Keeping your gut healthy and happy often comes down to what’s put in it. Diet and nutrition can make a BIG difference when it comes to managing gastrointestinal issues that make you feel like crud. The good news? It’s pretty simple to find food that allows your gut to flourish while taking care of business downstairs, says gastroenterologist Christine Lee, MD. So, let’s set a grocery store shopping list set to boost your gut health. “You are what you eat.” That old saying dates back to 1825 — and it’s as true today as when French bon vivant Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin penned the axiom in his renowned foodie book The Physiology of Taste. Two centuries of research have only reinforced the concept, says Dr. Lee. A healthy diet helps build a healthy gut, which is key for maintaining a strong immune system, boosting mental health and just feeling hunky-dory. Eating the right foods fortifies your gut’s complex microbiome and the trillions of microbes — including “good” bacteria ­— that call it home. It’s essential for your health to maintain a good balance of gut bacteria.",How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,275,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-improve-your-digestive-tract-naturally,How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,2025-09-03T02:37:12.755670,health.clevelandclinic.org
"“What you eat affects your gut health and overall health,” reiterates Dr. Lee. “If you put substandard food in, that balance is disrupted and your body will not treat you well.” So, what happens when your gut gets off kilter? Symptoms of poor gut health include: “It’s important to stay attuned to these symptoms, particularly when they seem to closely follow meals,” notes Dr. Lee. “These are all indicators that you might want to look at dietary changes to help your gut.” When it comes to selecting the right food to help your gut stay in tip-top shape, you’ve got a lot of options. In fact, it’s better for your system to eat a wide array of healthy foods, says Dr. Lee. Dietary diversity leads to a healthier microbiome with more species of “good” bacteria. That broader population of microbes puts your gut in a better position to handle anything that comes along. “You want to have a wide variety in your diet,” she says. “Try to mix it up.” Just make sure these foods are in (or out of) the mix. Plant foods are packed with soluble and insoluble fiber, which aid digestion and keep your gut’s plumbing flowing. (Regularly emptying out your bowels is something that makes your body happy, states Dr. Lee.) Aim for five to seven servings of fruit and vegetables per day. Be adventurous and get creative in the process, too. “Get lots of different colors on your plate — greens, reds, oranges, yellows,” recommends Dr. Lee. “A rainbow sort of diet will provide a wide variety of vitamins and nutrients your body needs.”",How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,269,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-improve-your-digestive-tract-naturally,How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,2025-09-03T02:37:12.755670,health.clevelandclinic.org
"Fresh produce is best, but canned and frozen fruit and veggies can offer extra convenience. (Try to avoid canned produce with added sodium or that’s swimming in sugar-sweetened syrup. Watch for extra sugar in frozen options, too.) Another way to stay “regular” with your bathroom routine is to eat food made with fiber-rich whole grains. The list in this category reads like a morning crop report in farm country, with grains such as: Whole grains that are unprocessed retain more natural goodness compared to milled or refined grains that have nutritious layers stripped off. When shopping for whole grain items such as bread or cereal, make sure that the words “whole grains” appear among the first ingredients listed. Try to choose items with at least 3 grams of dietary fiber per serving for the best benefit. (Learn more about how much fiber you need daily from a registered dietitian.) There’s something special in fermented foods … and it’s alive. (Don’t be spooked by that creepy fact. It’s actually a good thing.) Many fermented foods include live microorganisms that can be beneficial to your gastrointestinal health, says Dr. Lee. These foods bring more good bacteria to the party in your gut’s microbiome. Fermented foods are a type of probiotic. Examples of fermented food include: Kefir (a yogurt-like beverage). As we mentioned the probiotics, it’s only fair to mention prebiotics. Prebiotics work in tandem with probiotics to keep your gut and its microbiome operating at peak efficiency, explains Dr. Lee. In the simplest of explanations, prebiotics act as a food source to support the good bacteria in your gut while probiotics add to the population of good bacteria. (Learn more about probiotics and prebiotics and their unique relationship in this explainer from a registered dietitian.)",How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,293,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-improve-your-digestive-tract-naturally,How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,2025-09-03T02:37:12.755670,health.clevelandclinic.org
"Examples of prebiotics include garlic, onions, artichokes, bananas, apples and whole oats. The food on this list won’t surprise you. Odds are you’ve felt a little belly pain after overdoing it on one or more of the items. That’s a sign. “Your body has a way of sending a message,” says Dr. Lee. Foods to limit or avoid include: Salty, high-sodium items. Eating foods high in sodium content — chips, lunch meat and many prepared foods, for instance ­— can slow digestion and lead to bloating, says Dr. Lee. (Get tips for reducing your sodium and salt intake.) Processed foods. Preservatives added to processed foods really make things difficult for your digestive system. “It slows down motility and lets bad bacteria build-up,” she says. Fried food. Cooking food in oils laden with saturated fats just doesn’t lead to a finished product that sits well in your belly, which can lead to indigestion, gas and diarrhea. Artificial sweeteners. Let’s just say that any food items that are considered “artificial” will probably be more difficult for your body to process. (Add it to the list of health concerns with these low-calorie sugar imitators.) Red meat. Your gut’s response (and struggles) with red meat has been associated with increasing your risk of heart disease. Try to limit portions of red meat to no more than 3 ounces twice a week. In general, a diet with a heavy emphasis on plant-based foods will help your gut stay healthy and happy. And if you’re going to eat food on the “avoid-it” list — and let’s be honest, we all will — do so in moderation. “In general, though, simple foods are the best for our bodies,” says Dr. Lee. “Your gut will let you know that, too.” Learn more about our editorial process.",How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,298,https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-improve-your-digestive-tract-naturally,How To Improve Gut Health Naturally,2025-09-03T02:37:12.755670,health.clevelandclinic.org

"Jump to: What is the microbiome? How microbiota benefit the body The role of probiotics Can diet affect one’s microbiota? Future areas of research Picture a bustling city on a weekday morning, the sidewalks flooded with people rushing to get to work or to appointments. Now imagine this at a microscopic level and you have an idea of what the microbiome looks like inside our bodies, consisting of trillions of microorganisms (also called microbiota or microbes) of thousands of different species. [1] These include not only bacteria but fungi, parasites, and viruses. In a healthy person, these “bugs” coexist peacefully, with the largest numbers found in the small and large intestines but also throughout the body. The microbiome is even labeled a supporting organ because it plays so many key roles in promoting the smooth daily operations of the human body. Each person has an entirely unique network of microbiota that is originally determined by one’s DNA. A person is first exposed to microorganisms as an infant, during delivery in the birth canal and through the mother’s breast milk. [1] Exactly which microorganisms the infant is exposed to depends solely on the species found in the mother. Later on, environmental exposures and diet can change one’s microbiome to be either beneficial to health or place one at greater risk for disease.",The Microbiome • The Nutrition Source,221,https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/microbiome/,The Microbiome • The Nutrition Source,2025-09-03T02:37:15.253905,nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu
"The microbiome consists of microbes that are both helpful and potentially harmful. Most are symbiotic (where both the human body and microbiota benefit) and some, in smaller numbers, are pathogenic (promoting disease). In a healthy body, pathogenic and symbiotic microbiota coexist without problems. But if there is a disturbance in that balance—brought on by infectious illnesses, certain diets, or the prolonged use of antibiotics or other bacteria-destroying medications—dysbiosis occurs, stopping these normal interactions. As a result, the body may become more susceptible to disease. How Microbiota Benefit the Body Microbiota stimulate the immune system, break down potentially toxic food compounds, and synthesize certain vitamins and amino acids, [2] including the B vitamins and vitamin K. For example, the key enzymes needed to form vitamin B12 are only found in bacteria, not in plants and animals. [3] Sugars like table sugar and lactose (milk sugar) are quickly absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine, but more complex carbohydrates like starches and fibers are not as easily digested and may travel lower to the large intestine. There, the microbiota help to break down these compounds with their digestive enzymes. The fermentation of indigestible fibers causes the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that can be used by the body as a nutrient source but also play an important role in muscle function and possibly the prevention of chronic diseases, including certain cancers and bowel disorders. Clinical studies have shown that SCFA may be useful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. [2] The microbiota of a healthy person will also provide protection from pathogenic organisms that enter the body such as through drinking or eating contaminated water or food.",The Microbiome • The Nutrition Source,284,https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/microbiome/,The Microbiome • The Nutrition Source,2025-09-03T02:37:15.253905,nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu
"Large families of bacteria found in the human gut include Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, and Firmicutes. [4] In the colon, a low oxygen environment, you will find the anaerobic bacteria Peptostreptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium. [4] These microbes are believed to prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria by competing for nutrients and attachment sites to the mucus membranes of the gut, a major site of immune activity and production of antimicrobial proteins. [5,6] Can Diet Affect One’s Microbiota? In addition to family genes, environment, and medication use, diet plays a large role in determining what kinds of microbiota live in the colon. [2] All of these factors create a unique microbiome from person to person. A high-fiber diet in particular affects the type and amount of microbiota in the intestines. Dietary fiber can only be broken down and fermented by enzymes from microbiota living in the colon. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are released as a result of fermentation. This lowers the pH of the colon, which in turn determines the type of microbiota present that would survive in this acidic environment. The lower pH limits the growth of some harmful bacteria like Clostridium difficile. Growing research on SCFA explores their wide-ranging effects on health, including stimulating immune cell activity and maintaining normal blood levels of glucose and cholesterol.",The Microbiome • The Nutrition Source,218,https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/microbiome/,The Microbiome • The Nutrition Source,2025-09-03T02:37:15.255020,nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu
"Foods that support increased levels of SCFA are indigestible carbohydrates and fibers such as inulin, resistant starches, gums, pectins, and fructooligosaccharides. These fibers are sometimes called prebiotics because they feed our beneficial microbiota. Although there are supplements containing prebiotic fibers, there are many healthful foods naturally containing prebiotics. The highest amounts are found in raw versions of the following: garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens, bananas, and seaweed. In general, fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains like wheat, oats, and barley are all good sources of prebiotic fibers. Be aware that a high intake of prebiotic foods, especially if introduced suddenly, can increase gas production (flatulence) and bloating. Individuals with gastrointestinal sensitivities such as irritable bowel syndrome should introduce these foods in small amounts to first assess tolerance. With continued use, tolerance may improve with fewer side effects. If one does not have food sensitivities, it is important to gradually implement a high-fiber diet because a low-fiber diet may not only reduce the amount of beneficial microbiota, but increase the growth of pathogenic bacteria that thrive in a lower acidic environment. Probiotic foods may contain beneficial live microbiota that may further alter one’s microbiome. These include fermented foods like kefir, yogurt with live active cultures, pickled vegetables, tempeh, kombucha tea, kimchi, miso, and sauerkraut. Note that not all fermented foods contain live microorganisms, especially if they have been heated or pasteurized after fermentation that destroys the bacteria (e.g., sourdough bread, heat-treated fermented vegetables). Exploring probiotics and gut health Probiotics—whether from food or supplements—are a hot topic of consumer interest. However, would a relatively healthy person benefit from supplementation of probiotics, or is a fiber-rich diet sufficient for cultivating a robust gut microbiome?

"The microbiome is a living dynamic environment where the relative abundance of species may fluctuate daily, weekly, and monthly depending on diet, medication, exercise, and a host of other environmental exposures. However, scientists are still in the early stages of understanding the microbiome’s broad role in health and the extent of problems that can occur from an interruption in the normal interactions between the microbiome and its host.

"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that affects the stomach and intestines, also called the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include cramping, belly pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea or constipation, or both. IBS is an ongoing condition that needs long-term management. Only a small number of people with IBS have severe symptoms. Some people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and stress. More-severe symptoms can be treated with medicine and counseling. IBS doesn't cause changes in bowel tissue or increase risk of colorectal cancer. A Book: Mayo Clinic on Digestive Health Nutritional Supplements at Mayo Clinic Store Symptoms of IBS vary but are usually present for a long time. The most common include: Belly pain, cramping or bloating that is related to passing stool. Changes in appearance of stool. Changes in how often you are passing stool. Other symptoms that are often related include sensation of incomplete evacuation and increased gas or mucus in the stool.

"IBS is a functional disorder. Even though the digestive tract looks normal, it doesn't function as it should. Muscles in the intestines move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that moves the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscles in the intestines spasm. That means the contractions are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasms are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS results from oversensitive nerve endings in the digestive tract. Small bubbles of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating. See a healthcare professional if you have a persistent change in bowel habits or other symptoms of IBS. They may mean a more serious condition, such as colon cancer. More-serious symptoms include: Pain that isn't relieved by passing gas or stool.

Factors that appear to play a role include: Muscle contractions in the intestine. The walls of the intestines are lined with layers of muscle that contract as they move food through the digestive tract. Contractions that are stronger and last longer than usual can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea. Weak contractions can slow food passage and lead to hard, dry stools. Nervous system. Issues with the nerves in the digestive system may cause discomfort when the belly area, called the abdomen, stretches from gas or stool. Poorly coordinated signals between the brain and the intestines can cause the body to overreact to changes that typically occur in the digestive process.

"Severe infection. IBS can develop after a severe bout of diarrhea caused by bacteria or a virus. This is called gastroenteritis. IBS also might be associated with a surplus of bacteria in the intestines, known as bacterial overgrowth. Early-life stress. People exposed to stressful events, especially in childhood, tend to have more symptoms of IBS. Changes in gut microbes. Examples include changes in bacteria, fungi and viruses, which typically live in the intestines and play a key role in health. Research indicates that the microbes in people with IBS might differ from those in people who don't have IBS. Symptoms of IBS can be triggered by: Food. The role of food allergy or intolerance in IBS isn't fully understood. A true food allergy rarely causes IBS. But many people have worse IBS symptoms when they eat or drink certain foods or beverages. These include wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, milk and carbonated drinks. Stress. Most people with IBS experience worse or more-frequent symptoms during periods of increased stress. But while stress may make symptoms worse, it doesn't cause them.

"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms that occur together, including repeated pain in your abdomen and changes in your bowel movements, which may be diarrhea, constipation, or both. With IBS, you have these symptoms without any visible signs of damage or disease in your digestive tract. The most common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are pain in your abdomen, often related to your bowel movements, and changes in your bowel movements. These changes may be diarrhea, constipation, or both, depending on what type of IBS you have. Doctors aren’t sure what causes IBS. To diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), doctors review your symptoms and your medical and family history and perform a physical exam. Your doctor will look for a certain pattern in your symptoms. In some cases, doctors may order tests to rule out other health problems. Doctors may treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by recommending changes in what you eat and other lifestyle changes, medicines, probiotics, and mental health therapies. You may have to try a few treatments to see what works best for you. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment plan. Your doctor may recommend changes in your diet to help treat symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Changes may include eating more fiber, avoiding gluten, or following a special diet called the low FODMAP diet. Different changes may help different people with IBS. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.

"Symptoms & Causes of Gas in the Digestive Tract When should I talk with a doctor about my gas symptoms? What health conditions can cause problems with gas symptoms? Gas symptoms vary from person to person. Common symptoms of gas in the digestive tract include belching, bloating and distention, and passing gas. Having some gas symptoms is normal, especially during or after meals. Gas symptoms may be a problem if they occur often, bother you, or affect your daily activities. Belching, or burping, is a release of gas from your stomach through your mouth. People typically belch up to 30 times a day.3 Some people may feel they belch more often than normal. In some cases, people belch a lot because they swallow too much air and release the air before it enters the stomach. Bloating is a feeling of fullness or swelling in your abdomen, or belly. If your abdomen becomes larger than usual, doctors call this distention. Only about half of people with bloating also have distention.4,5 Some people may also feel abdominal discomfort or pain when they have bloating or distention. Studies suggest that people pass gas through the anus an average of 8 to 14 times a day.6 However, some people may pass gas more often. Experts consider passing gas up to 25 times a day to be normal.6,7 Excess gas in the digestive tract that leads to passing gas is called flatulence. The gas that passes is called flatus. People who have problems with flatulence may feel they pass too much gas or that the flatus has an unpleasant odor. The odor may be due to sulfur in the flatus. When should I talk with a doctor about my gas symptoms? You should talk with your doctor if",Symptoms & Causes of Gas in the Digestive Tract - NIDDK,293,https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/gas-digestive-tract/symptoms-causes,Symptoms & Causes of Gas in the Digestive Tract - NIDDK,2025-09-03T02:37:34.267975,www.niddk.nih.gov
"you have other symptoms—such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or weight loss—along with gas symptoms Gas normally enters your digestive tract when you swallow air and when bacteria in your large intestine break down undigested carbohydrates. You may have more gas symptoms if you swallow more air or consume more of certain foods and drinks. Everyone swallows a small amount of air when eating and drinking. Swallowed air that doesn’t leave your stomach when you belch may move into your intestines and pass through your anus. Swallowing more air may lead to more gas and gas symptoms. You swallow more air when you drink carbonated, or fizzy, drinks Bacteria in your large intestine Your large intestine contains a large number of bacteria and some fungi and viruses that make up the gut microbiome—the microbes in your digestive tract that help with digestion. Bacteria in the large intestine help break down carbohydrates and create gas in the process. Certain foods and drinks contain types of carbohydrates—sugars, starches, and fiber—that your stomach and small intestine don’t fully digest. Undigested carbohydrates will pass to your large intestine, where bacteria break them down and create gas. You may have more gas symptoms if you consume more carbohydrates that your stomach and small intestine don’t fully digest. What health conditions can cause problems with gas symptoms? Some health conditions can cause you to have more gas than usual or have more gas symptoms. IBS and other functional GI disorders Functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal bloating and distention, functional constipation, and functional dyspepsia may cause problems with gas symptoms.",Symptoms & Causes of Gas in the Digestive Tract - NIDDK,270,https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/gas-digestive-tract/symptoms-causes,Symptoms & Causes of Gas in the Digestive Tract - NIDDK,2025-09-03T02:37:34.267975,www.niddk.nih.gov
"Functional GI disorders are related to problems with how your brain and your gut work together. These problems can cause you to feel more bloating or abdominal pain or can affect how gas moves through your intestines. Problems digesting carbohydrates People who have problems digesting certain carbohydrates may experience digestive symptoms—such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea—after they consume certain foods or drinks. Problems digesting carbohydrates include lactose intolerance, in which people have digestive symptoms after consuming foods or drinks that contain lactose dietary fructose intolerance, in which people have digestive symptoms after consuming foods or drinks that contain fructose Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in your small intestine. These bacteria can produce extra gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is most often a complication of other health conditions. Other digestive diseases and conditions A number of other digestive diseases and conditions may lead to more gas or gas symptoms, including gastroesophageal reflux disease obstruction or blockage of the digestive tract, which may be caused by conditions such as colorectal, ovarian, or stomach cancer This content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

"Eating, Diet, & Nutrition for Gas in the Digestive Tract Can changing my eating and drinking habits or diet reduce gas or gas symptoms? If you have problems with gas symptoms, your doctor may recommend changing your eating and drinking habits or diet. People with certain health conditions may need to follow a special diet. Your doctor may refer you to a registered dietitian to help create a healthy eating plan. Check on the cost of a dietitian’s services and whether your health insurance may pay for some or all of these services. Changing your eating and drinking habits Your doctor may suggest changing your eating and drinking habits to reduce gas symptoms. For example, doctors may recommend avoiding or limiting how often you chew gum, suck on hard candy, drink fizzy drinks, and drink with a straw avoiding talking while eating or drinking eating slowly and, when possible, sitting down to eat instead of eating on the run eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of larger meals Some people have more gas symptoms when they consume certain carbohydrates that the stomach and small intestine don’t fully digest. When these carbohydrates reach the large intestine, bacteria break them down and create gas in the process. Examples of foods and drinks containing carbohydrates that may lead to excess gas include certain fruits—including apples, peaches, and pears—and fruit juices vegetables, especially cruciferous vegetables—a group that includes broccoli, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, and others—and legumes—a group that includes beans, peas, and lentils dairy products, such as milk, ice cream, and yogurt whole grains, such as whole wheat drinks that contain high-fructose corn syrup, such as fruit juices, soft drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks candy, gum, or other products that contain sweeteners ending in “–ol,” such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, and maltitol","Eating, Diet, & Nutrition for Gas in the Digestive Tract - NIDDK",300,https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/gas-digestive-tract/eating-diet-nutrition,"Eating, Diet, & Nutrition for Gas in the Digestive Tract - NIDDK",2025-09-03T02:37:37.727220,www.niddk.nih.gov
"Some people have more gas symptoms when they consume too much fiber. Others may have more gas symptoms when they eat high-fat foods, which can increase bloating. Talk with your doctor about your diet. Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of what you eat and drink and your gas symptoms. The diary can help your doctor or dietitian figure out whether certain foods and drinks could be causing your gas symptoms. Following a special diet to help treat health conditions If you are diagnosed with a health condition that could be causing your gas symptoms, your doctor or dietitian may recommend a special diet. For example, health care professionals may recommend following a gluten-free diet to treat celiac disease. reducing the amount of lactose in your diet to manage symptoms of lactose intolerance. reducing the amount of fructose, especially high-fructose corn syrup, in your diet to manage symptoms of dietary fructose intolerance. trying a low FODMAP diet for a few weeks to see if it helps with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. FODMAPs are carbohydrates that are hard to digest. Talk with your doctor or dietitian about a healthy eating plan that may help with your gas symptoms.

"Bloating happens when your abdomen (belly) enlarges and feels full and tight. Your stomach may even look like it’s sticking out. Feeling ""too full"" is common. Between 10% and 30% of people experience bloating. Many conditions cause it, which can make finding the reason a challenge. For instance, you might feel bloated because of: Constipation (less than three bowel movements per week) Gut sensitivity or IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) Diet choice or food sensitivities Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) Issues with your ovaries or uterus Celiac disease (an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten) Inflammatory bowel disease (inflammation of your digestive tract) Gastroparesis (slow emptying of the stomach into the small intestine) Here's a look at some of these in more detail. The most common way you get gas into your gut is to swallow it. Everyone gets gas in their intestines when they eat, but some people’s bodies react more severely to it, which can cause bloating. Many gastrointestinal (GI) conditions can lead to bloating, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis, and constipation. One study showed that 96% of people with IBS have bloating. Very few bacteria usually live in your small intestine (where food mixes with digestive juices).But if food moves too slowly through this area, bacteria can linger and start to ferment. This can lead to bloating. If you feel really bloated during your period, the drop in progesterone and estrogen levels may be the reason. Some medicines cause bloating as a side effect. Among them are aspirin, fiber supplements, and certain pain relievers. Cancers of the stomach, ovary, colon, and pancreas can have bloating as a symptom. Once the cause of your bloating has been found, your doctor can suggest some ways to manage it. Among the treatments they may advise you to try:",Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,298,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/remedies-for-bloating,Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,2025-09-03T02:37:40.719780,www.webmd.com
"This type of medication can help with bloating caused by food. It allows gas to pass more easily through your digestive tract. Simethicone helps you pass gas bubbles trapped in your intestines. Alpha-galactosidase breaks down the carbohydrates in vegetables and beans. Activated charcoal may reduce gas symptoms, but research hasn't shown a clear benefit. It could interfere with other medications, so check with your doctor before taking it. Lactase supplements help you digest the sugar lactose in dairy products. Physical activity can help clear gas from your body. Some studies show that yoga especially can be a safe way to reduce not only bloating, but belly pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Try gentle poses that stimulate digestion like: Wind relieving pose: Lie on your back and bring your knees to your chest. Place your hands on the top of your shins. Inhale and move your knees away from you. Exhale and draw your knees back into your chest. Virasana (hero pose): Kneel on the floor with your knees touching. (If this is uncomfortable, place a yoga block or small stack of books underneath your sitting bones.) The tops of your feet should be flat on the floor or yoga mat. Sit tall, breathing deeply for a few breaths. Child's pose: Kneel on the floor with your knees touching. Bring your toes together and spread your knees wide. Lower your torso between your thighs so your forehead rests on the floor. Relax your neck and straighten your arms overhead. Among the home remedies you can try to reduce bloating are: Several kinds may benefit your gut health. For instance: Peppermint has a long history as a digestive aid in folk medicine. Studies show that tea brewed from plant leaves and peppermint oil may relax your GI muscles. That could help with bloating.",Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,300,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/remedies-for-bloating,Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,2025-09-03T02:37:40.719780,www.webmd.com
"Ginger is another herb that may help with upper GI symptoms like bloating and constipation. Look for ginger tea at the store, or make your own by soaking a few peeled pieces of fresh ginger in boiling water for at least 10 minutes. Turmeric is a bright orange-yellow spice that's well-known in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. It has anti-inflammatory powers. To make a tea: add 2 teaspoons of turmeric powder to 1-2 cups of boiling water, simmer for 5 minutes, then strain. High doses of turmeric can interfere with some medications, so ask your doctor before you try it. Chamomile has been used for hundreds of years. Some studies show that this medicinal plant may relax your digestive tract. It could also relieve gas, indigestion, and diarrhea. Allergies to chamomile are rare, but you're more likely to have a reaction if you're allergic to ragweed. Fennel is used around the world for a number of ailments. Compounds in it appear to help relax the smooth muscles of your intestine and reduce gas. Dandelion may help clear extra fluids from your body by causing you to pee more. But more studies need to be done. Let your doctor know before you start using any herbs or herbal teas. Gently massaging your belly can relieve bloating by softening your stomach muscles and speeding up digestion. It's generally safe unless you're pregnant, have a belly wound, or live with a condition that affects your spine. Warmth on your belly can help soothe cramping muscles. Try a hot water bottle or heating pad, or take a warm bath.",Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,264,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/remedies-for-bloating,Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,2025-09-03T02:37:40.719780,www.webmd.com
"Eating too quickly causes you to swallow more air, which can lead to gas and bloating. Try to eat slowly, chewing each bite carefully. Mindful eating can make it easier to realize when you're full. Eating smaller, more frequent meals is another way you can try to cut back on bloat. If you notice certain foods causing you to bloat, try cutting back or avoiding them. Common culprits include wheat, beans, lentils, garlic, onions, and asparagus. Milk and dairy foods can also cause bloating if you have a hard time digesting lactose. Stomach bloating often happens when poorly digested carbohydrates begin to ferment in your colon. Many people find that a low-FODMAP diet helps. A low-FODMAP diet cuts out some or all of the following: Oligosaccharides: found in legumes, onions, garlic, wheat Disaccharides: such as lactose and found in dairy Monosaccharides: such as fructose and found in apples, pears, and honey Polyols: found in most stone fruits, cauliflower, chewing gum, and candies One option is to remove FODMAP foods that you suspect of creating bloat one at a time. Or you could try an elimination diet, removing all FODMAP foods and then slowly adding them back to see how they affect you. A food diary can help you keep track. Constipation can also cause stomach bloating, so a diet high in fiber can help with both conditions. If you have at least one of the following symptoms, you may be constipated: Incomplete or infrequent bowel movements Straining to start or complete bowel movements Drinking more water can help. You might also add kiwifruit to your diet, which has proven helpful in cases of bloating and constipation. In some cases, your doctor can prescribe a medication to reduce bloating and other GI symptoms. For instance:",Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,294,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/remedies-for-bloating,Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,2025-09-03T02:37:40.719780,www.webmd.com
"Certain kinds of antidepressants can prevent your body from overreacting to gas. Antispasmodics help reduce bloating as well as cramping and gas. Rifaximin is an antibiotic approved by the FDA for IBS treatment. A short course can help symptoms like bloating that may be caused by too much ""bad"" bacteria in your gut. Eating fiber can help prevent constipation and reduce bloating. But eating too much is one of the most common reasons for bloating. The key is to eat fiber in moderate amounts. If you're just starting to eat more fiber-rich foods like beans, lentils, broccoli, whole wheat, apples, berries, or quinoa, add them slowly to your diet. That way, your system can get used to them. Many people use probiotics (live ""good"" bacteria) to help with digestive issues. There's some evidence that taking them can help reduce stomach bloating, but more studies are needed to figure out which strains are most helpful. Over-the-counter enzymes can help you digest two foods that often cause bloating: dairy and legumes (such as beans). If you have a hard time digesting the sugars in these foods, you might try lactase supplements for dairy or alpha-galactosidase supplements for beans and other legumes. When you chew gum, you're swallowing more air, which can lead to bloating and burping. Sucking on hard candy has the same effect. Salt causes your body to hang on to extra fluids, which can make your belly feel full and tight. To cut back, try to eat less fast food or processed food that comes in a box, can, or bag. They tend to contain a lot of salt.",Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,269,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/remedies-for-bloating,Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,2025-09-03T02:37:40.719780,www.webmd.com
"Biofeedbackis a technique that helps you learn how to control some of your body functions, like your breathing and heart rate. It may help with IBS symptoms, but more studies need to be done. Most stomach bloating will resolve on its own. But see a doctor if it doesn't go away or if you notice any of the following: Change in stool color, consistency, and frequency Unexplained loss of appetite or feeling of being ""too full"" If you're an older person who doesn’t usually have bloating and you suddenly have it for more than a few days, your doctor will want to rule out other more severe conditions. Everyone feels bloated and ""too full"" sometimes. Often, it can be treated at home and prevented by watching the foods you eat. But if bloating's an ongoing issue, talk to your doctor to rule out a more serious cause. Bloating and pregnancy can both make your belly look full. Pregnancy can also cause constipation and indigestion, which are also causes of bloating. If you think that you may be pregnant, take a test to find out and follow up with your doctor.",Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,190,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/remedies-for-bloating,Remedies for Bloating: What to Do and When to See a Doctor,2025-09-03T02:37:40.719780,www.webmd.com
"Reviewed by Robert H. Shmerling, MD, Senior Faculty Editor, Harvard Health Publishing; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing Gut health is an easy thing to take for granted — or to ignore completely, if everything is generally functioning well. But poor gut health can impact your overall health in a variety of ways, from the obvious (stomach discomfort) to less obvious effects on mood and immune function. People are talking about gut health and their microbiome more than they used to, but if it's not something that comes up around your dinner table, here are some basics. When people talk about their gut microbiome, they're referring to all the microorganisms (both good and bad) living in your gastrointestinal tract (primarily your large intestine). Most people have hundreds — or even thousands — of different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in their gut. Gut diversity is important because different microorganisms may help support health in a variety of ways, including: improved digestion and nutrient absorption protection against harmful bacteria Plus, a healthy and diverse gut microbiome may help reduce your risk of conditions including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, some cancers, GI disorders, and cardiovascular disease. The good news is that you can take steps to support a healthy gut microbiome. Fiber serves as a prebiotic, or food for the good bacteria that live in your gut. Eating plenty of fiber is associated with increased microbial diversity and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal issues like constipation and Crohn's disease. Fiber helps keep the colon healthy by reducing inflammation; it also helps keep you regular.",5 simple ways to improve gut health - Harvard Health,267,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-simple-ways-to-improve-gut-health,5 simple ways to improve gut health - Harvard Health,2025-09-03T02:37:46.860877,www.health.harvard.edu
"However, most of us don't get enough fiber. Aim to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods including legumes, whole grains, avocados, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, tofu, berries, leafy greens, and nuts and seeds. Water is critical for healthy digestion. It helps your body absorb and transport nutrients; it helps with keeping your core body temperature steady; it aids in the production of mucus to protect your digestive tract; and it helps prevent constipation. When you become constipated, your gut microbiota changes, becoming less abundant. If you become dehydrated, your body will let you know, as not drinking enough can manifest as thirst, headache, dry mouth, less frequent urination, dizziness, and tiredness. So drink up — around four to six cups per day for most people. Increased stress often manifests itself in digestive discomfort. Stress causes hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to spike, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. This gut-brain connection is powerful; it's why we get butterflies before a big presentation, or feel nauseous when we're in a high-stakes situation. And while we can't avoid stressful situations entirely, it's possible to learn to manage stress through techniques like belly breathing, relaxation therapy, and meditation.",5 simple ways to improve gut health - Harvard Health,210,https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-simple-ways-to-improve-gut-health,5 simple ways to improve gut health - Harvard Health,2025-09-03T02:37:46.860877,www.health.harvard.edu
"Healthier gut, better sleep? Perhaps, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology, which found that certain bacteria in your gut may impact your sleep in a variety of ways, from your likelihood of experiencing insomnia, to how frequently you need to nap, to how long you stay asleep at night. Most people should aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. If you're struggling to hit that goal, try improving your sleep hygiene, getting plenty of daytime exercise, and trying some of the stress management tips above. It's not hard to find good reasons tostay active, but here's one more: According to a systematic review published in Nutrients, participating in 150 to 270 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise per week for at least six weeks has a positive effect on your gut microbiota, particularly if you combine aerobic exercise with resistance training. We already know that people who are sedentary have different gut microbiota characteristics than active people; this research suggests that you might be able to improve your gut health through exercise even if you're not currently active.

"Pay attention to your gut-brain connection – it may contribute to your anxiety and digestion problems The gut-brain connection is no joke; it can link anxiety to stomach problems and vice versa. Have you ever had a ""gut-wrenching"" experience? Do certain situations make you ""feel nauseous""? Have you ever felt ""butterflies"" in your stomach? We use these expressions for a reason. The gastrointestinal tract is sensitive to emotion. Anger, anxiety, sadness, elation — all of these feelings (and others) can trigger symptoms in the gut. The brain has a direct effect on the stomach and intestines. For example, the very thought of eating can release the stomach's juices before food gets there. This connection goes both ways. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person's stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause or the product of anxiety, stress, or depression. That's because the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system are intimately connected. This is especially true in cases where a person experiences gastrointestinal upset with no obvious physical cause. For such functional GI disorders, it is difficult to try to heal a distressed gut without considering the role of stress and emotion. Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it becomes easier to understand why you might feel nauseated before giving a presentation, or feel intestinal pain during times of stress. That doesn't mean, however, that functional gastrointestinal conditions are imagined or ""all in your head."" Psychology combines with physical factors to cause pain and other bowel symptoms. Psychosocial factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as symptoms. In other words, stress (or depression or other psychological factors) can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract.",The gut-brain connection - Harvard Health,297,https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection,The gut-brain connection - Harvard Health,2025-09-03T02:37:50.906897,www.health.harvard.edu
"In addition, many people with functional GI disorders perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. Stress can make the existing pain seem even worse. Based on these observations, you might expect that at least some patients with functional GI conditions might improve with therapy to reduce stress or treat anxiety or depression. Multiple studies have found that psychologically based approaches lead to greater improvement in digestive symptoms compared with only conventional medical treatment. Gut-brain connection, anxiety and digestion Are your stomach or intestinal problems — such as heartburn, abdominal cramps, or loose stools — related to stress? Watch for these and other common symptoms of stress and discuss them with your doctor. Together you can come up with strategies to help you deal with the stressors in your life, and also ease your digestive discomforts.

"Reviewed by Howard E. LeWine, MD, Chief Medical Editor, Harvard Health Publishing; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing Our gastrointestinal tracts contain about 100 trillion microorganisms, mainly bacteria. These organisms are collectively known as the gut microbiome. The vast majority of bacteria in our microbiome are good. Good bacteria's primary role is to counterbalance the bad kind to keep your gut healthy. They offer other health benefits as well. But sometimes the balance between good and bad bacteria gets disturbed. That's where probiotics come in. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts. They replenish your gut with more good bacteria to restore the balance between good and bad bacteria. Lesser known, but also important to maintaining a balanced microbiome, are prebiotics. Prebiotics are ingredients in certain foods that your intestines can't fully digest. Examples of prebiotics include some starches, oligosaccharides, inulin, and pectin. They tend to be most plentiful in high-fiber foods. Prebiotics work in tandem with probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that maintain or improve the balance of good to bad bacteria in your digestive system. Some examples of foods that contain probiotcs are yogurt, kimchi, many cheeses, pickles, kombucha, and sauerkraut. Prebiotics, on the other hand, act as nutrition for gut bacteria, helping them to flourish. When bacteria are fed what they need to stay healthy, they keep our bodies healthy in return. Potential health benefits of prebiotics Prebiotic foods can improve your gut microbiome and enhance your health. Experts are still learning more about the benefits of prebiotics. But research has found a link between higher prebiotic intake and improved intestinal absorption of dietary calcium a well-functioning immune system a reduce risk of colorectal cancer.",Prebiotics: Understanding their role in gut health - Harvard Health,278,https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/prebiotics-understanding-their-role-in-gut-health,Prebiotics: Understanding their role in gut health - Harvard Health,2025-09-03T02:37:54.739558,www.health.harvard.edu
"The role of prebiotics may extend beyond being a food source within your microbiome, too. One recent study showed that people who consumed 30 grams daily for two weeks of foods high in a plant-based prebiotic called inulin were more likely to select medium- to low-calorie foods over high-calorie ones. Furthermore, their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods. The study suggests that eating prebiotic foods might help people make healthier dietary choices. Prebiotic foods to add to your diet Prebiotics are found in a variety of high-fiber grains, vegetables, and fruits. Some of the best prebiotic foods include: wheat and whole-grain products such as cereals and breads. Eating more prebiotic food is not a good idea for everyone. For example, some people with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find a diet heavy in prebiotics worsens their symptoms. On the other hand, people who struggle with constipation may find improved bowel function with prebiotics. Finding the right balance of prebiotic food that works for you is key. Starting slowly and gradually increasing prebiotic foods can help avoid possible digestive discomfort. Lisa Catanese, ELS, Health Writer Howard E.

"The gut-brain connection is complex and bidirectional. Signals pass both ways between your digestive system and central nervous system, and health or disease in one can affect the other. Key players in this connection include your enteric nervous system, your vagus nerve and your gut microbiome. Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy What is the gut-brain connection? Your brain talks to your gut, and your gut talks back. If you’ve ever had a “gut feeling,” you’ve experienced this communication. It’s how the thought of an exciting event can make you feel “butterflies in your stomach,” while the thought of something dreadful might be “gut-wrenching.” And it’s how the feeling in your gut can influence your decision-making, as in “going with your gut”. Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Your brain communicates with all of your body through nerves (your nervous system). But your brain and your gut are like besties. They talk about all kinds of things, from practical, physical matters to emotional ones. More information passes between your brain and your gut than any other body system. In fact, there are more nerve cells in your gut than anywhere else in your body outside of your brain. What is the purpose of the gut-brain connection?",What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,246,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/the-gut-brain-connection,What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,2025-09-03T02:37:57.242323,my.clevelandclinic.org
"Our brains and digestive systems have evolved together to help us survive. What we eat is crucial to our overall health, and it has also varied a lot throughout history, depending on what was available. Our brains and guts needed to stay in close contact to make sure we got the nutrients we needed. And if we ate the wrong thing, or we needed to put the brake on digestion, we had to have a good alarm system in place. This alarm system includes the emotional part of your brain. After a physical injury, your emotional brain kicks in to help you remember to avoid that injury in the future. Emotion can make physical sensations in your gut seem more intense. Intense physical sensations can also raise your stress levels and your emotional response. This feedback loop is especially strong between your brain and gut. What types of body functions does the gut-brain connection affect? Studies suggest that crosstalk between your gut and brain may influence your: Food sensitivities and intolerances. Gut motility (muscle movements). What body systems are involved in the gut-brain connection? What healthcare providers refer to as the gut-brain axis is the network of nerves that connect your brain and gut and send signals back and forth. But your nervous system also works closely with your endocrine system, which produces hormones that communicate things like hunger, fullness and stress. And it works closely with your immune system to respond appropriately to injury or disease in your gut. Within this network, some of the key players in the gut-brain connection include:",What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,263,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/the-gut-brain-connection,What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,2025-09-03T02:37:57.243592,my.clevelandclinic.org
"Your enteric nervous system is the neural network that operates within your gastrointestinal (GI) tract and controls its digestive functions. With more than 500 million neurons, it’s the most complex neural network outside of your brain. It’s also unique in that it can operate somewhat independently from your brain and central nervous system. This has led some scientists to refer to it as a “second brain”. Your enteric nervous system is a special division of your autonomic nervous system, which governs the automatic functions of your internal organs. It operates as part of your overall autonomic nervous system, but also on its own. It can gather information about the conditions inside your GI tract, process that information locally and generate a response without sending it back to your brain. Your vagus nerve is the main link between your enteric nervous system and your brain. It’s one of your 12 cranial nerves, which begin in your cranium and travel down through your body, branching out along the way. Your vagus nerve conveys sensory information about the conditions inside your gut from your enteric nervous system to your brain. In response, it conveys motor signals from your brain to your gut. The vagus nerve mediates various reflexes that operate within your gut in response to changing conditions, like chemical changes or the presence of food. These are called vagal reflexes. Intrinsic vagal reflexes operate within your enteric nervous system without involving your brain. Extrinsic reflexes operate through communication between your enteric nervous system and central nervous system.",What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,255,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/the-gut-brain-connection,What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,2025-09-03T02:37:57.243592,my.clevelandclinic.org
"Believe it or not, the bacteria that live in your gut are also involved in your gut-brain connection. Gut microbes produce or help produce many of the chemical neurotransmitters that convey messages between your gut and brain. They also produce other chemicals that can affect your brain through your bloodstream. Your brain and gut, in turn, can affect your gut microbiome by altering its environment. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome may be involved in various neurological, mental health and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Functional disorders are those that cause persistent symptoms but don’t have any obvious physical cause. There’s a significant overlap among people who have functional gastrointestinal disorders, like IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), and who have mental health disorders, like anxiety. What types of medical conditions or symptoms might involve the gut-brain axis? Disorders related to the gut-brain axis may include: Irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation or diarrhea. Anxiety and depressive disorders. Neurodevelopmental disorders, like autism. Neurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinson’s disease. Nerve-related pain disorders, like multiple sclerosis. How do healthcare providers treat disorders of the gut and brain? Healthcare providers are experimenting with treating some of these disorders by treating your gut microbiome. Animal experiments have suggested that a healthier diversity of microbiota in your gut may help to relieve gastrointestinal, neurological, inflammatory and emotional stress symptoms. Results in humans are still mixed, but intriguing. They might treat your gut microbiome in several ways, including: Fecal microbiota transplantation.",What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,242,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/the-gut-brain-connection,What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,2025-09-03T02:37:57.243592,my.clevelandclinic.org
"People with certain functional gastrointestinal disorders may benefit from mind-body therapy with a behavioral medicine specialist. Several different types of therapies may be beneficial in relieving persistent GI symptoms, or at least learning to cope with them. They can also help improve your overall mood and stress levels, which may help your gut indirectly. Some of these therapies include: Relaxation therapy. This approach uses different techniques to help you relax and reduce your automatic reactions to stress. Techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, visualization and restful music. Research suggests these therapies are most effective when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The goal of this approach is to help people with GI disorders change their thoughts, behavior and emotional responses in relation to physical pain as well as mental/emotional stress and anxiety. Gut-directed relaxation training. This is a combination of deep relaxation with positive suggestions focused on GI function. An example would be placing your hands on your abdomen while being asked to feel warmth and imagine having control over your GI function. This approach may be helpful for people whose symptoms occur even without obvious stress. Biofeedback. This therapeutic training teaches a person how to control automatic body responses. An example would be learning how to control your heart rate or temperature with the assistance of an electronic device that provides feedback on these functions. Research has shown that biofeedback, in combination with other stress and symptom management techniques, has produced positive health effects in people with functional GI disorders.

"The best way you can take care of your gut health on a day-to-day basis — and maybe your brain health, as a result — is by maintaining a healthy, balanced diet. You can also take care of your brain health — and maybe, through it, your gut health — by doing what you can to manage your stress. Here are some ways to manage stress during intense times, and ways to relieve stress in your day-to-day life. What type of diet is good for my gut-brain axis? A good rule of thumb to improve your gut health naturally is to eat a good variety of whole foods, emphasizing plants. More diversity in your diet leads to a more diverse gut microbiome, which is good for your overall gut health. Whole foods and plants also pack more nutrition per calorie than processed foods, leaving less room for harmful additives, sweeteners and saturated fats. Instead, they offer: Soluble and insoluble fiber. Most plants have both kinds of fiber, which help keep your bowels regular and feed the helpful microbiota inside. These microbes, in turn, nourish your gut lining. Prebiotics and probiotics. Probiotics are the live bacteria in fermented foods, like yogurt and sauerkraut. Prebiotics are the fibers and complex starches that these bacteria like to eat. Antioxidants. Antioxidants, which occur naturally in a variety of fruits and vegetables, help to fight free radicals in your body and prevent inflammation. Different foods have different types. Anti-inflammatory foods. A whole-food, plant-rich diet is naturally anti-inflammatory because it reduces sugar, additives and cholesterol. This helps keep your gut microbes happy.",What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,266,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/the-gut-brain-connection,What Is the Gut-Brain Connection?,2025-09-03T02:37:57.243592,my.clevelandclinic.org

"From embarrassing gas to uncomfortable heartburn, everyone has digestive problems from time to time. The good news is there are some simple solutions for many of your troubles. Learn about what causes your discomfort, how to prevent and manage digestive problems, what questions to ask your pharmacist, and when to see a doctor. How does the digestive system work? It may seem like digestion only happens in your stomach, but it’s a long process that involves many organs. Together they form the digestive tract. Digestion begins in your mouth, where saliva starts to break down food when you chew. When you swallow, your chewed food moves to your esophagus, a tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Muscles in the esophagus push the food down to a valve at the bottom of your esophagus, which opens to let food into the stomach. Your stomach breaks food down using stomach acids. Then the food moves into the small intestine. There, digestive juices from several organs, like your pancreas and gallbladder, break down the food more, and nutrients are absorbed. What’s left goes through your large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water. The waste then moves out of your body through the rectum and anus. Digestive problems can happen anywhere along the way. Bloating and passing gas can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Here’s what you need to know. Gas is a normal part of healthy digestion. Air that is in your digestive tract is either released through your mouth as a burp or through your anus as gas. You typically pass gas 13 to 21 times a day.",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,267,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Gas is created when you swallow air, such as when you eat and drink. But it’s also a byproduct of the breakdown of food. Some foods cause more gas than others. You may also be more sensitive to particular foods and may have more gas when you eat them. Taking some medications can also cause gas. You’ve probably noticed you feel gassy after eating certain foods. Cut back on the common culprits: When gas builds up in your stomach and intestines, you may have bloating – swelling in your belly and a feeling of fullness. It may happen to you more often if you have: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This digestive condition causes stomach pain, cramping, and diarrhea or constipation. Celiac disease. When people with this condition eat gluten, their bodies produce antibodies that attack the intestinal lining. Hormonal changes that happen around women’s periods While bloating is usually just uncomfortable, it can sometimes cause pain in your belly or sides. How can I reduce gas and bloating? Diet and lifestyle changes can make a big difference: Avoid sweeteners that cause gas such as fructose and sorbitol. They are often found in candies, chewing gum, energy bars, and low-carb foods. What OTC medicines treat excess gas? If you have a lot of gas or are very uncomfortable, an over-the-counter medicine may help. Lactase supplements. If dairy is causing your problems, taking these tablets or drops just before you eat will help you digest lactose (the main sugar in dairy foods) and reduce gas.",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,253,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Alpha-galactosidase. This digestive aid comes as liquid or tablets. You take it before you eat to help your body break down the complex carbs or sugars that cause gas, such as those found in beans, broccoli, and cabbage. Caution: People with the genetic condition galactosemia should avoid it. It may also interfere with some diabetes drugs like acarbose (Precose) or miglitol (Glyset). If you take medication for diabetes, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this aid. Simethicone (Mylicon). Taking these liquids or tablets can relieve the uncomfortable bloating and pain from gas. Probiotics. These supplements contain ""friendly"" bacteria that can help digestion. In addition to tablets and powders you sprinkle on your food, foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut contain probiotics. Heartburn, sometimes called acid indigestion, is a painful, burning feeling in the middle of your chest or the upper part of your stomach. The pain, which can also spread to your neck, jaw, or arms, can last just a few minutes or stick with you for hours. There’s a muscle at the entrance of your stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), that acts like a gate: It opens to let food move from your esophagus to your stomach, and it shuts to stop food and acid from coming back out. When the LES opens too often or isn’t tight enough, stomach acid can rise up into the esophagus and cause the burning feeling. Triggers vary from person to person, but you may be more likely to get heartburn when you: Eat spicy, fatty, acidic, or greasy foods Some people have a higher risk of heartburn, including those who are: Have a hiatal hernia, where the stomach bulges up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm How should I change my diet to avoid heartburn?",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,300,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"You might have noticed that your heartburn gets worse when you eat or drink certain things. Here are a few that can trigger heartburn: Oranges, lemons, and other citrus fruits and juices Vinegar, hot sauces, and salad dressings Big meals can also set off heartburn. Instead of eating three big meals a day, try to eat several small meals throughout the day. What else can I do to prevent heartburn? Lose weight if you’re overweight. Extra pounds put pressure on your stomach, forcing more acid up into your esophagus. Wear loose clothing. Tight clothes that press on your stomach can trigger heartburn. If you smoke, quit. Cigarette smoke relaxes the muscle that prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus. It also may increase how much acid your stomach makes. Check your medicines. Regular use of anti-inflammatory and pain medicines (other than acetaminophen) contributes to heartburn. If heartburn bothers you at night: Eat a light dinner and avoid foods that trigger your heartburn. Don’t lie down for at least 2 to 3 hours after you eat. Use blocks or books to raise the head of your bed by 4-6 inches. Or put a foam wedge under your mattress at the head of the bed. Sleeping at an angle will help stop acid from backing up into your esophagus. Exercise has more than a few health perks. Among them is weight loss, which can help you avoid getting heartburn in the first place if you are overweight. But some types of exercise can trigger the burning sensation. You’ll be less likely to reach for your heartburn medicine if you avoid crunches and inverted poses in yoga. You may need to find alternatives to high-impact workouts. For example, bicycle or swim instead of going for a run.",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,295,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Everyone has heartburn from time to time. But when you have it frequently (at least twice a week for a few weeks), or when it begins to interfere with your daily life or damage your esophagus, your doctor may tell you that you have a long-term condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It’s also known as acid reflux disease. Heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD. What are other symptoms of GERD? Besides the frequent burning in your chest, you might also have symptoms like: Bad breath or a sour taste in your mouth or in the back of your throat Feeling like you have a lump in the back of your throat Difficult or painful swallowing Frequent heartburn is a symptom of GERD. It’s important to get help if you have heartburn frequently so you can avoid complications from GERD and uncover any other problems. Call your doctor or make an appointment with a gastroenterologist, who specializes in digestive illnesses. Many of the symptoms of heartburn sound like a heart attack. If you’re not sure, call 911. What are the complications of frequent heartburn and GERD? Over time, heartburn that isn’t treated or controlled well by lifestyle changes or medicine may cause serious problems, including: Breathing problems like asthma, nighttime choking, and repeated pneumonia Changes in the cells that line the esophagus, called Barrett’s esophagus. This can possibly lead to cancer of the esophagus. Painful inflammation of the esophagus called esophagitis Narrowing of the esophagus, called an esophageal stricture. This can cause problems swallowing. What medicines can I take to treat heartburn? Several types of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicines can help with heartburn. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you find the one that’s right for you. What type of antacid should I choose?",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,298,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Soothe occasional, mild heartburn with an antacid that contains calcium carbonate or magnesium. They help neutralize stomach acid. Some prevent acid reflux. Those that contain magnesium may also help heal stomach ulcers. They come in liquids and pills and are fast-acting. What are the side effects of antacids? Antacids can cause constipation and diarrhea. Look for brands that contain calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and aluminum hydroxide to reduce these side effects. Don’t take antacids with magnesium if you have chronic kidney disease. Some antacids have a lot of salt, so you should take them only for occasional heartburn. H2 blockers help relieve and prevent occasional heartburn by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Though they don’t work as fast as antacids, their effects last longer. Your doctor may tell you to take an antacid and an H2 blocker together. H2 blockers are for short-term use – less than 2 weeks. You can take them before your meals to prevent heartburn, or at bedtime. They come in liquids and pills. All H2 blockers work about the same. So if one doesn’t help with your heartburn, switching to a different one isn’t likely to help. Switching to a higher-dose prescription version of the drug might help, though. Talk to your doctor if over-the-counter H2 blockers aren't working for you. Some H2 blockers can interfere with other drugs, including: Medicines for heart rhythm problems Talk to your doctor if you take any of these medicines and you need to take an H2 blocker. What are the side effects of H2 blockers? The most common side effects are mild and include:",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,269,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"PPIs are used to prevent frequent heartburn that happens more than twice a week. They work by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Often, they work better than H2 blockers. You also can take these drugs for a longer period of time than H2 blockers. PPIs are available over the counter and by prescription. But if you have GERD, you may need prescription-strength medication. You need to take PPIs once a day on an empty stomach so they’ll work best. Usually you’ll take the medicine every morning, about 30 to 60 minutes before you eat breakfast, to control stomach acid. Talk to your doctor before taking the PPI called omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) if you take clopidogrel (Plavix), a drug used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Taking the two drugs may make clopidogrel less effective. What are the side effects of PPIs? The most common side effects are mild and include: PPIs may also raise your chances of getting kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine, and may lead to low magnesium levels. The risk is highest in people who take high dose PPIs for a year or more. Prokinetics help your stomach empty faster, so you have less acid left behind. Usually you take this medicine before meals and at bedtime. Prokinetics are sold only by prescription. What are the side effects of prokinetics? Prokinetics can have more serious side effects than PPIs or H2 blockers. These include: Yes. If your heartburn isn’t getting better, your medicines cause side effects you can’t tolerate, or you have other complications, you may need surgery. It is rare to need surgery for heartburn.",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,276,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. It can be helpful to keep a journal to note what you eat and drink and when you have heartburn. This will help you and your doctor pinpoint your triggers. If medicine and lifestyle changes don’t control your heartburn, you can take one of these tests to find out what's causing the problem: pH test. This measures the acidity of your esophagus. The doctor will either attach a small sensor to your esophagus or place a thin tube down your esophagus. Endoscopy. A long, thin tube with a camera and light on the end is put down your esophagus so your doctor can look inside your esophagus and stomach. Endoscopy can look for problems such as an ulcer or narrowing inside your esophagus. Barium X-ray. You’ll drink a liquid that coats the inside of your digestive tract. Then X-rays are taken, which will allow your doctor to see the outline of your digestive system. When is heartburn an emergency? Heartburn is usually a minor problem that goes away over time. But if you also have other symptoms, it could be a sign that something more serious is wrong. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if: You have black, tarry-looking bowel movements. Your mouth or throat hurts when you eat. You have difficulty swallowing foods Your vomit contains blood or what looks like coffee grounds. Is it heartburn or a heart attack? Heartburn doesn’t affect your heart, but it can feel a lot like the chest pain that happens during a heart attack.

They may cause diarrhea, headache, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. They may also cause kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine How do I know if I’m constipated? What’s considered a normal number of bowel movements varies from person to person. If you are straining when going to the bathroom, you are probably constipated. You may also have hard stools or a feeling that your bowel movement isn’t complete. Occasional constipation is common, but if you have less than three bowel movements in a week, see your doctor. There are many causes of constipation, and sometimes you have more than one: Traveling or changing your routine Taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, iron, and some pain medications (particularly narcotic pain medications) Medical conditions including cancer, diabetes, IBS, and hypothyroidism Blockages in the large intestine Problems with the nerves or muscles around the large intestine or rectum If you are constipated for more than 2 weeks, are losing weight, have blood in your stool, or you are having severe pain, see your doctor. These may be signs of a serious problem. How can I prevent and treat constipation without medication? Drink plenty of water (60-80 ounces per day). An extra two to four glasses a day may help.

"When lifestyle changes don’t solve your problems, there are several over-the-counter medications that can help. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about which medicine is right for you. Be sure to read labels carefully before taking these medicines. Using some over-the-counter treatments for constipation for more than 2 weeks can make your symptoms worse and may be a sign of something more serious. Bulk-forming laxatives. You take these fiber supplements with water to bulk up your stool, which can trigger your bowels to push it out. Some common bulk laxatives are methylcellulose, polycarbophil, psyllium, and wheat dextrin. Lubricants, like mineral oil. They coat the surface of the intestine and block water from being absorbed from the stool, which helps it pass more easily. Osmotic agents. These help keep more water in the intestine, which can expand the intestine and stimulate a bowel movement. Osmotic agents are not for some older adults and people with heart or kidney failure. Talk to your doctor before taking this type of medicine. Stool softeners. By adding fluid to stools, softeners help you avoid straining and make them easier to pass. Stimulants. These laxatives make the intestines contract, which helps move the stool. Suppositories or enemas. Some laxatives come in a form that can be inserted into the rectum. These are helpful when you have to avoid straining, such as after surgery or childbirth. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum and the anus, and they can be uncomfortable. They can be either inside the rectum (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). Internal hemorrhoids usually don’t cause discomfort, though straining to have a bowel movement may cause them to bleed or lead to spasms in the muscles of the rectum, which can be painful.

Bleeding can also be a symptom of something more serious. Constipation or straining during bowel movements causes most hemorrhoids. You may also have hemorrhoids if you don't get enough fiber in your diet. Being pregnant or overweight can cause hemorrhoids because of the extra pressure on your rectum. Hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy can also weaken the muscles of the rectum and anus. You’re also more likely to get them if you sit for long periods of time. And they're more common as you get older. Other causes include having diabetes, a past rectal surgery, and colon cancer. If you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. They can recommend treatment and make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition. You should also see your doctor if your hemorrhoids haven’t gotten better with treatment. You may need to see a doctor who specializes in hemorrhoids. How can I treat hemorrhoids without medication? Add fiber to your diet to help relieve constipation and make your stools softer. This will make it easier to have bowel movements and reduce the pressure on hemorrhoids. Exercise to help relieve constipation. Don’t strain during bowel movements. Soak in a plain, warm bath or sitz bath (a few inches of water that covers your private parts and bottom) to help relieve the pain. Use moist wipes instead of dry toilet paper so you don’t irritate the area any further. Apply an ice pack or cold compress to help with swelling. Avoid spicy foods to prevent itching. Which OTC medications treat hemorrhoids?",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,291,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Medications include creams, suppositories, pads, and ointments. Most products contain witch hazel or hydrocortisone, which can help stop the itching and swelling and may ease pain. Most over-the-counter medications should not be used for more than a week. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about which is the best option for you. Diarrhea is loose, watery stool that sends you to the bathroom more often than usual. When you have diarrhea, you may have stomach pain and cramps or bloating. Many things cause diarrhea, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, medications, and medical conditions that affect the stomach, intestines, or colon. What you eat can also be a culprit. If you have occasional, mild diarrhea, there is probably no reason for concern. But if it lasts for more than 2 days and hasn’t improved, you should call your doctor. If your infant or child has diarrhea, call your pediatrician. You should also call your doctor if you have diarrhea along with any of these symptoms: Dehydration. Signs of dehydration include feeling very thirsty, having a dry mouth or skin, having little or no urine, having dark yellow urine, and feeling weak. Drink plenty of fluids (water, sports drinks, fruit juice) to keep from getting dehydrated. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and dairy. If you aren’t nauseated, you can eat plain, bland, low-fiber foods including bananas, plain white rice, toast, and crackers. As long as you don’t have other symptoms that worry you, you may also try some over-the-counter treatments: Loperamide (Imodium): This comes in liquid and capsules. It works by slowing movement in your intestines and colon so you can absorb more water, making the stool less watery. Talk to your doctor about taking this medicine. Do not give it to children under 2.",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,290,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Pink Bismuth): This medicine reduces mild diarrhea and comes in liquids, capsules, and chewable tablets. You shouldn’t take it if you’re allergic to aspirin or have a fever. Don’t give it to children under 2. If you’re taking a blood thinner, don’t take this medicine before talking to your doctor. Probiotics: The same supplements that can help with bloating from gas may also help relieve some types of diarrhea by adding “good” bacteria to your digestive system. Fiber is a natural part of plants. There are two types. Both are important and work in different ways. Soluble fiber dissolves in water, turning into a gel. Think of it as a sponge, soaking up fluid. Soluble fiber can help with diarrhea, which happens when there is too much water in your colon. It also slows the emptying of your stomach so you feel fuller longer, which can help you lose weight. Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in water. Think of it as a broom: It helps keep food and waste moving through your body. Because insoluble fiber attracts water in your gut, it makes stools softer and easier to pass. Eating a diet rich in insoluble fiber can help with constipation. Women should get about 25 grams of fiber per day. Men should get 38 grams. If you have trouble getting enough fiber from foods, your doctor may suggest you take fiber supplements. Water is essential to good health and normal bowel function. Water also helps keep stools soft but solid and well-formed. Avoid drinking beverages such as coffee or soda if you think they trigger your digestive problems.",Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,270,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-health-tips,Simple Ways to Manage Digestive Problems and Gastrointestinal Complications,2025-09-03T02:38:00.226402,www.webmd.com
"Your digestive tract is full of different kinds of bacteria. You may think that is a bad thing, but most of the bacteria in your gut are healthy. They break down toxins, help your body make some vitamins, and play a role in keeping you healthy. But when you have too much of some kinds of bacteria, you may get an illness or have unpleasant symptoms. Probiotics are like the healthy bacteria in your body. Eating foods that contain them, or taking probiotic supplements, can help keep a balance of good and bad bacteria in your body. Experts aren’t sure exactly how they work, but probiotics may help: Prevent harmful bacteria from growing in your stomach Destroy the bacteria that make you sick Make B vitamins your body needs Which foods contain probiotics?

"Bloating, gassiness, and abdominal discomfort aren’t limited to the occasional holiday feast. It can happen even if you haven’t eaten a large meal. In some cases, bloating can even cause distention, or a perceptible swelling of the abdomen. Bloating and gas are usually not signs of a serious health problem. They're tied to what and how you eat, so a few simple changes may help. Here are three common causes of bloating, and how you can avoid them. Overeating is probably the most common cause of bloating. Smaller portions should ease the pain. Eating rich and fatty food can make you feel uncomfortably stuffed. Fat takes longer to digest than protein or carbohydrates, so it keeps the stomach full longer. Avoid bloating by limiting fats in your everyday diet. Eating too fast adds to the risk of bloating after a meal. The remedy is simple -‑ eat more slowly. Satiety signals can take up to 20 minutes to reach the brain and ease your appetite. Many weight loss experts believe that eating slowly helps prevent overeating. The second most common cause of temporary bloating is gas in the abdomen. About half of gas in the digestive system is swallowed air. The rest is produced by bacteria in the gut that help digest food. If the gastrointestinal tract does not move it through efficiently, gas builds up in the intestines, causing bloating and discomfort. If you often experience bloating caused by gas, avoid these habits that make you swallow more air: Some people swallow more air when they’re nervous. It’s possible that practicing ways to reduce stress and anxiety, such as breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation, may help reduce excess gas and bloating. Difficult-to-digest foods can cause gassiness and bloating. These are some familiar culprits.",Bloating 101: Why You Feel Bloated,295,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/bloated-bloating,Bloating 101: Why You Feel Bloated,2025-09-03T02:38:02.993635,www.webmd.com
"Beans and lentils are very healthy foods that contain indigestible sugars called oligosaccharides. These sugars must be broken down by bacteria in the intestines. Fruits and vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, prunes, and apricots. These items contain sugars and starches that may cause gassiness and bloating, even though these foods are good for you. Sweeteners can also cause gas and bloating. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener, can’t be digested. Fructose, a natural sugar added to many processed foods, is hard for many people to digest. To avoid bloating, be aware of these sweeteners in the foods you eat and limit the amount you consume. Dairy products can be a source of intestinal distress and bloating if you have trouble digesting lactose, or milk sugar. Whole grains, recommended for their many health benefits, can sometimes cause bloating and gas problems. One reason whole grains are so healthy is their high fiber content. But fiber is an indigestible carbohydrate. Abruptly increasing the amount of fiber you eat can cause gas, bloating, and constipation. Nutritionists recommend slowly adding more fiber into your diet to allow your body time to adjust. At the same time, drink plenty of water with high-fiber foods, says nutritionist Joanne L. Slavin, PhD, RD, professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota. “All fiber absorbs water,” she says. Drinking liquids helps fiber move through the digestive system and prevents bloating and constipation. When to Ask Your Doctor About Bloating Temporary bloating is common and nothing to worry about. But if you’re troubled by bloating on a regular basis, talk to your doctor.",Bloating 101: Why You Feel Bloated,268,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/bloated-bloating,Bloating 101: Why You Feel Bloated,2025-09-03T02:38:02.993635,www.webmd.com
"Physical obstructions such as scarring of the stomach opening can make it hard for food to pass through the digestive tract normally. If your doctor diagnoses a physical obstruction in the stomach or small intestines, surgery may be needed to correct it. Bloating can also be caused by impaired muscle function in the digestive tract. When muscles that normally move food along don’t work properly, gas can build up in the small intestines, causing bloating. In some cases, gas in the intestines may go the wrong way, returning to the stomach. Persistent bloating or distention may also signal potentially serious conditions, such as enlargement of one of the abdominal organs or a malignancy. What Else You Can Do About Bloating If eliminating or reducing consumption of hard-to-digest foods doesn’t solve your frequent bloating problem, there are over-the-counter medications that might help. Look for a pill or liquid containing alpha-D-galactosidase, an enzyme that breaks down indigestible sugars in beans and vegetables. Tablets or capsules containing simethicone can also help alleviate symptoms of excess gas. If you smoke, intestinal distress may be one more reason to quit. Smoking has been linked to bloating, heartburn, and other digestive problems. Fortunately, bloating is rarely a symptom of serious trouble. For most people, the most effective prescription for bloating is simple: control portion sizes, go easy on fats, and eat slowly enough to give your body time to signal when you’ve had enough. These sensible remedies should keep you from feeling overstuffed and bloated.",Bloating 101: Why You Feel Bloated,249,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/bloated-bloating,Bloating 101: Why You Feel Bloated,2025-09-03T02:38:02.993635,www.webmd.com
"Prebiotics are types of fiber that feed your friendly gut bacteria. Here are 19 healthy foods rich in prebiotics. Prebiotics allow your gut bacteria to produce nutrients for your colon cells, which leads to a healthier digestive system. Some of these nutrients include short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which can be absorbed into your bloodstream and improve metabolic health. However, prebiotics shouldn’t be confused with probiotics, which are live bacteria found in certain foods or supplements. Read on to explore 19 healthy prebiotic foods to add to your grocery list. Chicory root is a great source of prebiotics. Approximately 68% of chicory root fiber comes from the prebiotic fiber inulin, which is a compound that helps improve digestion and bowel function and helps relieve constipation. The greens of dandelion flowers can be cooked or consumed raw. They contain fiber, a high portion of which also comes from inulin. The Jerusalem artichoke — also known as the sunroot, sunchoke, or earth apple — is part of the sunflower family. It, too, contains inulin-rich dietary fiber. Along with its other benefits, inulin helps increase the friendly bacteria in your colon, promoting greater digestive health. It can also aid in the absorption of minerals in your large intestine. Garlic is a flavorful herb linked to various health benefits. Garlic acts as a prebiotic by promoting the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria in the gut. It also helps prevent disease-promoting bacteria from growing. Onions have many health benefits. They are also rich in inulin, as well as fructooligosaccharides (FOS). FOS is a type of carbohydrate that helps strengthen gut flora and helps with fat breakdown. Leeks come from the same family as onions and garlic, and they offer similar health benefits.",Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,289,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/19-best-prebiotic-foods,Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,2025-09-03T02:38:34.023630,www.healthline.com
"Leeks are nutrient-dense, which means they’re low in calories but high in vitamins and minerals. Thanks to their inulin content, leeks promote healthy gut bacteria and help break down fat. Asparagus is a popular vegetable and another great source of prebiotics. Like other foods on this list, this nutritious vegetable naturally contains inulin. Bananas also contain some inulin. Unripe (green) bananas are also high in resistant starch, which has prebiotic effects. In addition, bananas contain a variety of other compounds beneficial to health. Barley contains beta-glucan, which is a prebiotic fiber. Beta-glucan in barley has been shown to lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It may also help lower blood sugar levels. Whole oats are a healthy grain with prebiotic benefits. Like barley, they contain beta-glucan fiber, as well as resistant starch. Oats also contain various phytochemicals that act as prebiotics. Research also suggests that in addition to their prebiotic properties and their positive impact on healthy gut bacteria, they have other health benefits, such as helping lower cholesterol. Apples contain pectin, a type of soluble fiber with prebiotic benefits. Pectin increases butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that feeds beneficial gut bacteria and decreases the population of harmful bacteria. However, more research is needed to fully explore the benefits of pectin in humans. Konjac root, also known as elephant yam, is a tuber — or a vegetable grown underground, like the potato. Flour made from this tuber contains 70% to 90% of a highly viscous dietary fiber called glucomannan fiber, which can act as a prebiotic by promoting the growth of good gut bacteria. It also has many other health benefits.",Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,278,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/19-best-prebiotic-foods,Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,2025-09-03T02:38:34.023630,www.healthline.com
"Cocoa beans are seeds from the Theobrama cacao tree used to make chocolate. Cocoa powder makes it easy to add cocoa to oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, and other recipes. Cocoa is a rich source of polyphenols, such as flavanols, which exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds also help grow beneficial gut bacteria while reducing the growth of harmful bacteria. Burdock root is a vegetable commonly used in Japan and has proven health benefits. Burdock root is rich in inulin and FOS, which support the growth of healthy bacteria in the digestive tract. It also also contains phenolic compounds. Flaxseeds are a great source of prebiotics. The fiber in flaxseeds promotes healthy gut bacteria and encourages regular bowel movements. They also contain phenolic antioxidants. Yacon root is a vegetable very similar to sweet potatoes that is rich in fiber. It is particularly rich in prebiotic FOS and inulin. It also contains phenolic compounds that give it antioxidant properties. Jicama root is low in calories and high in fiber, including the prebiotic fiber inulin. In older animal research, jicama root was shown to help improve digestive health, enhance insulin sensitivity, and lower blood sugar levels. Wheat bran is the outer layer of the whole wheat grain. It contains a special type of fiber made of arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS). In animal research, AXOS fiber from wheat bran has been shown to boost healthy Bifidobacteria in the gut. In humans, wheat bran has also been shown to help increase the presence of Bifidobacterium in fecal matter, which leads to softer stools in healthy individuals whose digestion was slow. Seaweed is a form of marine algae rich in prebiotics, as well as other healthy compounds.",Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,280,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/19-best-prebiotic-foods,Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,2025-09-03T02:38:34.023630,www.healthline.com
"Lab studies have shown that polysaccharides found in seaweed can increase the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which nourish the cells lining your gut. However, more human research is needed to explore the full benefits of seaweed. Like apples, avocados contain pectin, which has prebiotic properties. Research suggests that eating avocadoes regularly can help decrease the levels of bile acids in the feces, increase levels of healthy fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids, and lead to a higher presence of good gut bacteria. Prebiotic foods are high in special types of fiber that support digestive health. They promote the increase of friendly bacteria in the gut, help with various digestive problems, and even boost your immune system. Prebiotic foods have also been shown to improve metabolic health and even help prevent certain diseases. Since the fiber content of these foods may be altered during cooking, try to consume them raw rather than cooked to gain the full health benefits. With a variety of options available, you can take your time to find the best prebiotic foods for yourself and your gut.",Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,182,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/19-best-prebiotic-foods,Prebiotics: The 19 Best Prebiotic Foods You Should Eat,2025-09-03T02:38:34.023630,www.healthline.com

"Research suggests that eating too much sugar may lead to increased inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation can be the precursor to several diseases, including cancer. If you eat high amounts of sugar, your gut health may be compromised. 3. Unintentional weight changes Gaining or losing weight without changing your diet or exercise habits may be a sign of an unhealthy gut. An imbalanced gut can impair your body’s ability to absorb nutrients, regulate blood sugar, and store fat. Weight loss may be caused by malabsorption because of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). On the other hand, weight gain may be caused by insulin resistance or increased inflammation. 4. Sleep disturbances or constant fatigue Research indicates that an imbalance in gut bacteria may be linked to fragmented sleep and short sleep duration, which may lead to chronic fatigue. While the cause remains unclear, it appears to be connected to inflammation, metabolic function, and mental health. Skin conditions like psoriasis may be related to the types of bacteria present in the gut. Lower concentrations of beneficial bacteria may impact the body’s immune system and your skin health. Many studies have found connections between the gut and the immune system. An unhealthy gut may increase systemic inflammation and alter the proper functioning of the immune system. This may lead to autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks itself mistaking its cells and organs for harmful invaders. Food intolerances are the result of difficulty digesting certain foods. This is different than a food allergy, which is caused by an immune system reaction to certain foods. Research indicates that food intolerances, like lactose intolerance, may be caused by poor quality of bacteria in the gut.
